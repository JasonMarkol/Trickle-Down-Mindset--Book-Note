# Fix what is brokenâ€” fast. Do it now. When things go in the
ditch, pull them out now. If it is even likely that something
might be cracked, broken, or slipping into the ditch, CEOs
act preemptively to fix it now. A related concept is that of
changing fast. In other words, if the marketplace is suddenly
moving in a new direction, the CEO must move appropriately, move quickly, and, where possible, move ahead of the
game once he or she understands where the market is going,
or figure out a better direction. Fix it now, challenge it now,
change it now, stop it now. Leaders learn that most strategies
fail because of timidity, hesitation, and indecision
