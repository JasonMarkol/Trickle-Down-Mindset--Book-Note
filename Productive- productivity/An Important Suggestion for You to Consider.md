My suggestion is that you begin by looking at the kinds of
literature and sources leaders use to keep themselves informed.
The following is a list of publications that CEOs tell me they
routinely review:<br/>
Harvard Business Review<br/>
Forbes<br/>
Sloan Management Review<br/>
Fortune<br/>
Barron ’ s<br/>
Wall Street Journal (every day)<br/>
Jack Welch ’ s writings and books<br/>
Berkshire Hathaway ’ s annual report (any year)<br/>
Directors and Boards<br/>
BoardRoom<br/>
Executive Book Summaries (monthly summaries of new business books)<br/>

When I ’ ve queried CEOs and other leaders about the most<br/>
important business writers and thinkers, those they pay attention<br/>
to, these are the names that crop up every time:<br/>
Peter Drucker<br/>
John Kotter (professor, Harvard)<br/>
Warren Bennis (consultant)<br/>
James Collins (consultant)<br/>
Tom Peters (business philosopher)<br/>
Joseph Rotman (professor, Rotman School of Management,<br/>
University of Toronto)<br/>
Noel Tichy (author, lecturer, human resource executive)<br/>
Stephen Covey  <br/>
Most leaders admire and read about or study other leaders —
past and present. Identify those your boss cares about and then
learn about them, too. Also read about and learn from other
leaders who are of interest to you.<br/>
Take your pick. All these kinds of writings are extremely
helpful in understanding the mentality, attitudes, behaviors, and
aspirations of leaders.<br/>
Studying leadership should lead you to discover more
interesting ways to be of service, to create more powerful and
purposeful ideas and suggestions, and to develop a deeper understanding of how you can help those you advise achieve bigger and
better things on a regular basis.<br/>
You may well find yourself in some fascinating discussion
that explores what past leaders can teach the leader you are now
advising. In the next chapter, we will look at what leaders will
expect from you in this role.<br/>
