# Knowing Is Half the Battle 

Simply being aware that employers are looking beyond the job description for quality candidates can give you a leg up on the job search competition. This opens the door for you to explore opportunities you may have never otherwise considered. Walking into the interview process well-informed and fully aware of the opportunity in front of you is half the battle when it comes to appearing confident, competent and right for the position. Remember: The people interviewing you are on your side. They are looking for the best fit for their company, just as you're looking for a place to fit in.

# In Your Interview, Focus on Your Soft Skills
While hard skills can be taught, soft skills cannot, making them more attractive. Hard skills are things like your ability to use Microsoft Word and your knowledge of accounting – in other words, things that are teachable. Soft skills are a little less quantifiable. Soft skills determine how you interact with your colleagues and your attitude in the office; they speak to your professionalism, personal values and ability to work as part of a team.

When it comes to the interview, use anecdotes to demonstrate your soft skills to potential employers. Make sure to weave in stories about your work ethic and about those times that you had to learn new skills in order to succeed at your job. If the job involves team projects, emphasize not only your past experience working in teams, but also your ability to prioritize and bring team members together to complete a task.

# If the Odds Are Stacked Against You, Put Your References in Your Corner

Even if you're not an ace interviewee, it may not mean the end of the road for you in the position you're seeking. Be sure to have strong references lined up. Your references can tell a fuller story about you and they can tell a hiring manager things about you that a resume and interview cannot.

One of the most important things a reference can do is speak to your soft skills. Your references have seen you in action and they can speak to your ability to problem-solve, your enthusiasm and your ability to handle feedback – all key qualities that employers are looking for. If you think that the job you want is "out of your league," but you've noticed the job description places a lot of emphasis on being able to communicate effectively with clients, make sure that your references can speak to your great communication skills! Their feedback from working with you can mean a lot more to a hiring manager than personal tales of your time working with clients.

# If You're a Recent Graduate, Be Eager to Learn 

If you have an innate drive and the basic skill set needed for the job, you have leverage. As a person joining the workforce for the first time, your "willingness to learn" might be your most attractive quality, and you shouldn't shy away from using this to your advantage. For example, make it clear that even though you didn't major in marketing, you're eager to learn and you have a keen interest in the topic. As a recent graduate, you can be a tremendous asset to an organization with your fresh ideas and your recent academic knowledge.

Companies are beginning to take calculated risks by hiring candidates outside of the job description. Take advantage of this! Go back to the career page of your dream company and fill out that application – you may be more qualified than you think.
