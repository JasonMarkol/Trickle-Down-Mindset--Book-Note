What did I learn from that process? The first thing was
that going about it on my own really didn't lead
anywhere. Right? Like, you can learn a little about
what to do from reading about it, watching certain
videos on it, but it's not until you have an experienced
eye in-person say something to you, talk to you, give
you that environmental exposure, give you that
feedback. It just took ten, twenty minutes, it wasn't
like I spent weeks with these guys there. But it being
in-person instead of over the Internet made such a
huge impact. Because it's not just the skills that you're
getting, for a temporary moment when you're first
starting, you have no confidence that you can do it.
Who else can else relate to this? Youâ€™re not sure you
can do it at the start, right? And for that temporary
starting point, it's really, really, valuable, if you can
have someone who has that confidence, and they can
zap it in you. Just enough for you to get started. Just to
carry you through the first 50 yards, right? And thenonce you've gotten past that hump, you get a little
confidence, you make some sales, you get some early
wins, you have momentum going for you. Now you can
start building on it, now you can start doing it yourself,
you can take the training wheels off. You don't need
them anymore. But that's crucial, that's so important.
So that was one that was huge.
