　　　　２０８０　法则：　
    Get thefundamentals perfect and see if you can hold that for 6 months. Then start
adding in the small stuff that will get you 1% more gains, as long as they
don’t interfere with the big stuff.

【Grooming,　Hygiene, and Fashion】



Hair - a haircut that costs $30-$40 looks
infnitely better than a $10 haircut.  

you should be getting a haircut every 3 weeks at the least
(unless you have long hair). Any less than that and it starts to look lazy. For
hair grooming, if you should be using shampoo every day if your hair is oily,
at least every other day if it’s not. Use Head and Shoulders brand everyday if you have dandruff. Putting product in your hair is also fne, but talk
to your barber about specifcally what type of product and how to style it.
