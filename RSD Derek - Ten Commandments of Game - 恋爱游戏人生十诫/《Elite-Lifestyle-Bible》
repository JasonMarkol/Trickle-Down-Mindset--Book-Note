【Grooming,　Hygiene, and Fashion】



Hair - a haircut that costs $30-$40 looks
infnitely better than a $10 haircut.  

you should be getting a haircut every 3 weeks at the least
(unless you have long hair). Any less than that and it starts to look lazy. For
hair grooming, if you should be using shampoo every day if your hair is oily,
at least every other day if it’s not. Use Head and Shoulders brand everyday if you have dandruff. Putting product in your hair is also fne, but talk
to your barber about specifcally what type of product and how to style it.

[Mouth]

» First, tell a few close friends and wings to always call you out if you
have bad breath. If you’re not around anyone you know, lick an eating
utensil and then smell it. If it smells bad, you have bad breath.

» Also, you would think most guys reading this brush and ﬂoss twice
a day, but a surprising amount do not. This is absolutely essential:
Flossing not only increases gum health (which improves your breath),
it also gets rid of tiny particles of food that if left between your teeth
will rot and smell. In addition, you should be brushing your tongue
with toothpaste and using mouthwash twice a day.

[Fashion]
» First, your clothing should present the specifc archetype that most
fts your personality and tribe. If you still haven’t fgured this out,
go back and listen to commandment seven. In particular, you want
clothing that portrays you as the highest status person in that tribe.
So, if you’re a lawyer, you should be wearing suits that look like you
just made partner, not like you just started your summer internship.
If you’re a rocker, you should look like the guy on stage, not the guy
at the back of the crowd. Very simple way to know what this means:
look at pictures of famous people that are in your tribe and have your
archetype. What does their style look like? What specifc types of
clothing are they wearing?

Next, I’m going to give you the biggest secret to what makes a person
look fashionable. Wearing clothes that ft perfectly. This is the
number one aspect making any item look fashionable or out of place.

[ On Peacocking ]

The idea of peacocking, was that if you wore one or two
items that made you stand out, you would get more attention. However,
what it became was an arms race to see who could look the weirder and
more out of place. The idea in context is good: If you can fnd one or two
accessories or clothing pieces that stand out and obey the above rules it
can work great for you.
