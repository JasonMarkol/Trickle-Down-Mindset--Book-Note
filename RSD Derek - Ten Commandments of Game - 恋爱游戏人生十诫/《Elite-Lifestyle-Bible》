adding in the small stuff that will get you 1% more gains, as long as they
don’t interfere with the big stuff.

【Grooming,　Hygiene, and Fashion】



Hair - a haircut that costs $30-$40 looks
infnitely better than a $10 haircut.  

you should be getting a haircut every 3 weeks at the least
(unless you have long hair). Any less than that and it starts to look lazy. For
hair grooming, if you should be using shampoo every day if your hair is oily,
at least every other day if it’s not. Use Head and Shoulders brand everyday if you have dandruff. Putting product in your hair is also fne, but talk
to your barber about specifcally what type of product and how to style it.

[Mouth]

» First, tell a few close friends and wings to always call you out if you
have bad breath. If you’re not around anyone you know, lick an eating
utensil and then smell it. If it smells bad, you have bad breath.

» Also, you would think most guys reading this brush and ﬂoss twice
a day, but a surprising amount do not. This is absolutely essential:
Flossing not only increases gum health (which improves your breath),
it also gets rid of tiny particles of food that if left between your teeth
will rot and smell. In addition, you should be brushing your tongue
with toothpaste and using mouthwash twice a day.

[Fashion]
» First, your clothing should present the specifc archetype that most
fts your personality and tribe. If you still haven’t fgured this out,
go back and listen to commandment seven. In particular, you want
clothing that portrays you as the highest status person in that tribe.
So, if you’re a lawyer, you should be wearing suits that look like you
just made partner, not like you just started your summer internship.
If you’re a rocker, you should look like the guy on stage, not the guy
at the back of the crowd. Very simple way to know what this means:
look at pictures of famous people that are in your tribe and have your
archetype. What does their style look like? What specifc types of
clothing are they wearing?

Next, I’m going to give you the biggest secret to what makes a person
look fashionable. Wearing clothes that ft perfectly. This is the
number one aspect making any item look fashionable or out of place.

[ On Peacocking ]

The idea of peacocking, was that if you wore one or two
items that made you stand out, you would get more attention. However,
what it became was an arms race to see who could look the weirder and
more out of place. The idea in context is good: If you can fnd one or two
accessories or clothing pieces that stand out and obey the above rules it
can work great for you. 



On cologne 古龙香水:
A little is ok. A lot is a fucking train wreck. In general people should not be
able to smell it unless they are very close to you.
Look, don’t get lost in this stuff. Take these guidelines, make this your
project for the week, and get it done. 


[Health]

1. They do not smoke, do drugs, or drink to excess
2. They eat diets that are high in fruits and vegetables, and low in
processed foods and sugar
3. They regularly sleep 8 hours a night (MUCH more important than
you may think)
4. They exercise
The tricky thing about health is that most people know what do, but
they don’t quite understand why they’re supposed to do it, and they lack
the structure to do it easily. 

[Sleep]

For those of you who have a hard time falling
asleep, follow these rules for a couple of weeks:

1. No blue light two hours before bed. (Blue light from computers,
phones, TVs, sends signals to your pineal gland to stop producing
melatonin, your body’s primary sleep hormone.

2. No stimulants 8 hours before you go to bed.
3. Exercise at some point during the day for at least 30 minutes, but not
within 2 hours of your bedtime.
4. Go to sleep at the same time every night (Yes, I realize this is hard
if you are going out to bars and clubs on the weekends. In that
case, make sure you are asleep every night at the same time during
weekdays).
5. Do not nap during the day.
6. Sleep in a room that is pitch black (Cover your windows), and slightly
cool (Around 65 degrees). Use ear plugs to block out sound.

If the above rules are followed perfectly and you still have trouble
sleeping, go to your doctor and get a sleep study. You may have sleep
apnea or clinical insomnia.

[Continuous Learning]

So how do you structure your continual learning? Well, let’s think about
what kind of learning you want to engage in. There is:
» Traditional education (college, grad school, and continued learning
classes)
» Live programs/events
» Books
» YouTube Videos/ Online audios/ Online articles
» Home programs (Such as this)
» Personal coaching sessions (Such as Bootcamp)


【we work on one thing at time ！！！】
Each of these are useful in the right situation, but too much, or too varied
content, can strain your bandwidth and ensure that you will learn nothing
at all. Remember, we work on one thing at time. This means that frst you
need to get clear on which project you are currently working on. Maybe
you’re in poor health, and you need to change your habits. Maybe you
need a career change. Clearly, you’re currently dedicated to tremendously
enhancing your dating/sex life! Whatever it is, it needs to be clear in
your mind, and you need to dedicate a block of time to it until it’s actually
fnished. Once you have decided what your primary project is, you need to
start looking at which type of education will help further that goal


【Learn one piece  at a time ！！！】
【Listen to one piece of content that is specifc to your current
goal or sticking point, then listen to it again and again. Don’t jump around,
it’s not going to be helpful to you！！！】
Online videos and audios: A lot of guys in the community get bogged down
with this stuff. They want to see EVERY RSD video that comes out. This is
better than doing nothing, but it’s far from ideal. By overloading yourself
with such a wide variety of information, you end up not implementing
anything. I will watch several videos every month, on something I am
SPECIFICALLY working on. I will then listen to that audio or video over
and over until it is completely instilled in my brain. I’ve listened to Charles
Munger’s talk on cognitive biases probably 40 times. I suggest you do
the same. Listen to one piece of content that is specifc to your current
goal or sticking point, then listen to it again and again. Don’t jump around,
it’s not going to be helpful to you. This is why I structured THE Ten
Commandments of Game how I did. It hits you on every possible learning
style, so you can absorb and retain the content rapidly and implement it
until it is entirely habituated. You will want to review many pieces of this
content several times, to ensure your highest levels of success possible.
