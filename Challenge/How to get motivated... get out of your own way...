Get out of your own way...

Please for the love of all that is good... get the heck out of your own way...

After years of turmoil, wishing, dreaming, and talking with friends. I realized a painful thing...

I WAS HOLDING MYSELF BACK!

Not my boss, parents, friends, education, or anything else. It all came back to me. I was the one telling myself I couldn't do what I wanted. I was the common denominator...

What shifted? I had a few epiphanies...

I was the one ignoring my intuition.
I was the one trying to keep everyone around me happy.
I was the one thinking that I just have to settle for how life was.
I was the one believing I was stuck in life.
I was the one allowing fear, pain, and struggle run my life.
Do you see what happened? I started to realize I was playing the victim in life and didn't want to take ownership of the struggles I was putting myself into.

When I accepted the fact that I was the one choosing to go to work and not work towards my dreams my heart started to shift.

So let me ask you this... In what areas of your life are you holding yourself back? Where are you playing the victim that you need to take ownership?

It is a common thread in my conversations that everyone wants to shoot for their ambitions, but they are the biggest thing holding themselves back...

Here are some simple ways to break through this mindset.

[Pick one area in life that you feel stuck in.]

Then... - Think about why do you feel stuck? - What is holding you back? - Is there something you can change in that situation? - Are you playing the victim in this situation?

[Take a small action.]

What can you do right this moment or tomorrow to do to take one step towards that dream you feel like you will never attain?

Ask yourself what can you plausibly do right now.

A wall would never be completed if the mason got overwhelmed by the idea of laying one brick at a time.

Have patience, give yourself grace, and take action.

The ball is in your court now... take action...

GO!
