It's not 2007 anymore！ not just create content  happy all time ...

what you should do ahead ? Like I said , you gotta go more direct ... That means ,what I would teach ,for example ...

forget about building a brand ,forget about building a following whatsoever,money first , then brand . You can always build a brand later.

 focus on selling first ...  We call this is  - manual lead generation   -   First you get 1000 a month and then you can start implementing samll 
 
 micro content things - I mean don't go mess focus on a small niche market ...  put litte blog content on your facebook twittr ,
 
 make manual lead generation ...basically the profiles that you're using to do manual lead generation ...  
 
 you can post specific type of content that just shows potential clients that you are real , that you can actually help them ...
 
  We talk much deeper on that in our programs .   （大哥谢谢你 大概思路你都讲完了 我只需要按照这个思路去做就可以了 谢谢！虽然不能参加你的课程！
  
  嘻嘻！）
  
  And then you make 50K a month , and you know how to sell , building your brand make ,  again here small niche brand ...
  
  Forget about creating a broad brand and cecoming the fitness influencer with a blue check mark .
  
  
  Only Find a small niche audience that is able to afford your services ...
  
  
  Use social media as like a little bit of an amplification of the revenue that you're generating ,
  
  not as your source of revenue in the first place . Ok? wake up ~
