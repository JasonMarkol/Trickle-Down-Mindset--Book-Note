Here's an easy hack that will break you to DOS in any Windows Protected Mode
computer. As you know, a Protected Mode Progman has no File menu, and you
cannot exit Windows or change properties of programs. How do we get around
this? Easy.
   You first need a floppy disk containing the following files:
   COMMAND.COM
   WINHELP.EXE
just make that disk, and find the computer you need DOS access on. Now,
with the disk in the drive, follow these steps:

1) Open the Accessories group
2) Open Write
3) Choose File|Open
4) Open A:\COMMAND.COM
5) Choose NO CONVERSION. THIS IS VITAL!!!
6) When COMMAND.COM is open, choose File|Save As...
7) Save the file as C:\WINDOWS\WINHELP.EXE

Now, exit Write, and choose Help|Index or Help|Contents from the Progman
menu. BOOM! You're in DOS. Now, copy the WINHELP.EXE that's on your floppy
back to C:\WINDOWS\WINHELP.EXE, so no on will inadvertantly do the same
trick. Now, do whatever you want, but note: For a reason I have been unable
to discover, the prompt is not the normal one, so you may want to set the
prompt with the command PROMPT $P$G.That'll take care of the problem.
Just type EXIT to return to windows.
