So RPW stresses don't have sex without commitment, don't continue in a relationship without knowing he sees you as potential wife, etc.
HOWEVER, in my experience this theory doesn't work. What I mean is:
-it never works to have the relationship talk before sex. Men absolutely need to try sex with you in order for them to vet your relationship potential.
-men don't like pressure and there's often the mentality of "I choose you because I want to, not because I have to" (basically he's also constantly vetting you, making sure you're a cool enough woman for him to always go back to, instead of staying with you because of a relationship label).
-in my experience what really only works is first finding a man who lets you know he's thinking of marriage, who makes it clear he's interested in you, you also make it clear you're interested in marriage, and then LET IT GO and continue being an awesome woman and hope that he will choose you for commitment eventually down the road WHEN HE FEELS READY and also secure in your love. I've noticed men won't ask you to marry them if they don't feel like you will stay with with through the unknowns of life. Unfortunately this takes a lot of time especially in young generation (it's more rare to fly through dating stages and get straight to marriage, it's more common to just explore life together for a few years and then he realizes you're a great partner so he upgrades your status).
-men may date you and vet you and see you as potential wife but for some reason they never like to TALK about it or tell you. They show you in other ways. Such as involving you in their life or taking you to meet his friends. There are other ways for him to show you're "his girl" without constantly talking about it but I noticed men really hate the discussion of it.
Thoughts???
