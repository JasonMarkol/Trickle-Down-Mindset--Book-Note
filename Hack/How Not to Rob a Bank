How not to rob a bank

The following is an excerpt from Tim Clark's "How Not to Rob a Bank" Here
are some easy lessons gleaned from the experiences of a number of would-be
robbers.

PICK THE RIGHT BANK
You don't want to make the same mistake as the fellow
in Anaheim, CA, who tried to hold up a bank that was no longer in business
and had no money.

STUDY YOUR HISTORY
Don't try to stick up the First National Bank of Northfield, Minnesota.
Jesse James tried it 111 years ago, and the townsfolk took just seven
minutes to kill two and capture three of his gang. Nobody  tried again
until 1984, and the customers chased the guy down. They're tight with their
dollar, those Minnesotans.

SPEAK TO THE RIGHT TELLER
One robber in Upland, CA, presented his note
to the teller, and her father, who was in the next line, got all bent out
of shape about it. He wrestled the guy to the ground and sat on him until
authorities arrived.

DON'T SIGN YOUR DEMAND NOTE
Demand notes have been written on the back of
a subpoena issued in the name of a bank robber in Pittsburgh... on an
envelope bearing the name and address of another in Detroit....and in East
Hartford, Connecticut, on the back of a withdrawal slip giving the robber's
signature and account number.

DON'T ADVERTISE
A teenage girl in Los Angeles tried to distract attention
from her face by wearing a see-through blouse with no bra while holding up
banks.

GO EASY ON THE DISGUISE
One robber, dressed up as a woman with very heavy
make-up, ran face first into a glass door. He was the first criminal ever
to be positively identified by lip-print.

TAKE RIGHT TURNS ONLY
Avoid the sad fate of the thieves in Florida who
took a wrong turn into the Homestead Air Force Base, drove up to a military
police guardhouse and, thinking it was a toll-booth, offered the security
men money.

BE AWARE OF THE TIME
 Or the chagrin of the bank robber in Cheshire, Massachusetts, who hit
the bank at 4:30 PM, then tried to escape through downtown North Adams,
where he was trapped in rush hour traffic until police arrived.

CONSIDER ANOTHER LINE OF WORK
Bank robbery is not for everyone. One
nervous Newport, RI robber, while trying to stuff his ill-gotten gains into
his shirt pocket, shot himself in the head and died instantly.

BE STRONG
 Then there was the case of the hopeful criminal in Swansea,
Massachusetts, who, when the teller told him she had no money, fainted. He
was still unconscious when the police arrived. His getaway car, parked
nearby, had the keys locked inside it.
