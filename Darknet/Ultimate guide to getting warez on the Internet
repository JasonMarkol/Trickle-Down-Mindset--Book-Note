Subject: Ultimate Guide to Getting WaReZ on the Internet

***********************************************************************

Warez sites are a very poor source of warez for the majority of the
links don't work or are linked to FTPs that are constantly full/busy.
Also many warez sites are highly infested with demos and legally free
software.  Probably due to ripping from other warez sites that are also
infested with demos and/or the webmaster trying to 'puff up' his warez
list by putting demo/shareware links that are easily confused as warez.
Warez sites is the most user-frienly, eye appealing way to get warez
though.

I've seen a major improvement as far as finding and getting warez on
the web, but it is on the downfall right now as many of the good sites
are getting shut down.

My three favorate warez sites:

http://www.twofast.com/twoslow
http://www.warezuniverse.net/frames.htm
http://www.warezclan.com/main.html

Watch out for the porno ads. Warez sites get A LOT OF HITS and
have much potential to make money from advertisers. However, execpt
for NetRadio, the people who are willing to pay for advertising
on a warez site are Porno sites and Porno site hacking sites.
Other people who advertise on warez sites are high risk credit card
companies, credit search services, and astrology/psychic services.

***********************************************************************

Another way to find warez is through usenet newsgroups.  It's not
a great way to get warez directly.  It is mostly advertisements
of warez sites, warez ftp sites, trades, and site-lists.  Most
'sign up for this.. sign up for that..' usually come out dry.
Some of the alt.binaries.... groups have a shitload of warez posted
directly on the newsgroups, however.

***********************************************************************

Warez can also be obtained by trading.; EfNet is the best IRC network
for Warez. Just do a /list warez and it will find all the channels that
have the
word 'warez' in it's name. Most of these non-hidden channels are
predominantly
trading/advertising channels.  You will find many trade offers and ads
to FTP
sites and FServes (Mirc Hosted IRC-DCC-FTP), most of which are ratioed
and slow.
Undernet is the 2nd best IRC network for warez.

***********************************************************************

A good source of warez are reliable, fairly fast ratio FTPs. They
have an excellent selection of warez due to the fact that you have to
upload warez to download warez.  The diligence and skill of the FTP
owner has a signifcant amount of impact on the quality of the FTP
site's warez contents.  For a FTP with a bad sysadmin cound
have a lot of demos and betas from cheaters and/or a lower selection
of warez due to hackers bypassing the ratio enforcement.

You can also get a lot of good warez by finding reliable 0-day warez
FTP sites that are not horribly slow.

***********************************************************************

Another good source of warez is DCC/XDCC from warez offering bots on
IRC.
2 good channels on EfNet are #exceed and #warezwarez.

A line of a listing:

 #13 14x[30.7M] Ultima Underworld I & II *FULL* CD
|Bot Name  |List|# |size |Name of warez software                       |
             #   d/l

Command format to request warez from an offering bot:

/msg [bot's name]  xdcc send# [List #]

Examples:

 #11  9x[11.5M] Ultima 8: Pagan
 #2   51x [4.3M] eudora 3.02 final [07.03.97]
 #3 21x [4.3M] Eudora Pro 3.02 FULL
 #13 14x[30.7M] Ultima Underworld I & II *FULL* CD

1st: /msg MIND-DCCZ xdcc send #11
2nd: /msg DMC-DCC99 xdcc send #2
3rd: /msg ABS-DCC68 xdcc send #3
4th: /msg MIND-DCCZ xdcc send #13

Most bots require a minimum download speed of 30kbps, which is very
difficult to obtain on DCC with a non-X2 modem.  It is possible with
33.6, but not very probable at all.  the best channel that I know of
for getting warez from bots is #exceed of EfNet.   Another problem is
that the bots have a limit of # of concurent downloaders and many also
limit the size of the 'waiting room' queue.  With some bots, you'll be
waiting in the queu for 2 hours before being able to download...if
there's even room in the queu.  You will also find many ads from warez
groups recruitments on this channel (Got to look for them for the bots
are constantly filling up the channel window with the list of the warez
they are offering).

***********************************************************************

The best source of warez, and the highest level of illeagality is
joining a warez group and earning full membership status.  You will
most likely get access to the groups private FTP/Distribution Sites, or
at least be able to grab a copy of the warez that you are currying.  If
you have a fast server with a fast connection, sign up as a site-op and
prepare for a massive flood of warez if the group gives your site a lot
of courrier traffic.
