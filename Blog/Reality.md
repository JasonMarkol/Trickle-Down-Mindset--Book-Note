# Reality

Reality decides to punch me in the face<br>But nothing like discrimination of race<br>I feel like I&apos;m in the wrong place <br>Everyday I have to put on a smiling face <br>I can&apos;t do anything I want anymore <br>I can&apos;t play video games on floor <br>I can&apos;t play sports till I get sore<br>Know what reality has in store<br>For me it&apos;s work 90%, play 10%<br>Life has the advantage<br>I&apos;m the underdog with a disadvantage <br>But I figure I can manage <br>Don&apos;t get me started on a place to live<br>Trying to stay imaginative <br>With life keeping me from being creative <br>All I can do is move forward and stay active <br>So I continue to try with all my might<br>Cuz I&apos;m the only one building at this site<br>The site of my life that make me feel right<br>But life&apos;s got me staying up all night<br>Cuz right now life sucks<br>But the only thing running dry is my luck<br>And not cuz I don&apos;t have a truck<br>But cuz I got the bang but no buck<br>I have big ideas with no money for it<br>Without it I aint gonna fit<br>I will walk the road bit by bit <br>And do my best to keep that torch lit<br>Just use the hard working mentality <br>Still running with such vitality <br>Only to get hit again by reality</p>
