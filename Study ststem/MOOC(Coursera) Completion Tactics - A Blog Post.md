Finishing Coursera courses is hard. Yes, I know because I have 5 unfinished courses in my Inactive tab. It takes real effort & dedication to complete a course. Common reasons for abandoning courses are:

Losing interest in the subject matter.

I start a course that seems interesting and useful, but in mid-way through the course, I find the subject matter boring and not relevant to my needs.

Schedule conflicts.

I start a course believing I will have enough free time to take the course. Sometimes, I even start taking multiple courses at the same time. But schedule conflicts between my work & other activities lead me to abandon the courses before they finish.

However, it completely changed after I applied special tactics for taking MOOC courses. Now, I finish courses regularly, whether it is 1 month long or 2 months long, or even longer.

The following are my special tactics for finishing MOOC courses.
<br/>

# 1. Have a very specific reason for taking a course.
<br/>
Take a long look at the course subject & syllabus before deciding to take a course. Is the subject matter interesting & useful? Is the difficulty good for you? Is the course offering University and Professor acknowledged for excellent teaching skills? Do your research, and come up with a very specific reason to take this course. You must be able to write your reason for taking a course in one sentence. An example would be “I’m taking a Compiler class from Stanford because I want to participate in programming language-related Open Source project in the future.” With this goal fully formed, you will be able to convince yourself better to carry this course to its completion.

# 2. Plan your course schedule in advance.
<br/>
Treat your courses like you would treat your work schedules, gym schedules, etc. They must have their own place in your weekly schedule. Do not start a course without a weekly/monthly plan. It will fail. Just thinking “Oh, I will do this in my free time” isn’t enough. I usually plan to work on my course fully on Sunday. Acknowledge the workload, and plan accordingly.

# 3. Be lax, but constant.
<br/>
This is about recovery from missed due dates, schedule changes, etc. It’s not easy to recover from one missed week, mainly because a course usually has a final due date that you must keep. However, in Coursera, there is a functionality to carry over the course to its next session. Use it when needed. Also there are self-paced courses in other MOOC sites(Stanford’s excellent Lagunita comes to mind), and in this case there is no guilty conscience involved in skipping a week. However, I advise you to never miss a weekly due date for more than 1 week. It is very hard to go back to the course after longer period. You would have forgotten what you have learned, and crucial rhythm for finishing weekly assignments is hard to maintain after that.

<br/>
These 3 tactics help me finish a course after a course. I hope they help you finish your next Coursera course, too. What are your tips for finishing a MOOC course? Share them below.
