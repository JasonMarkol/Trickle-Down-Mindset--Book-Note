LPT: If you're browsing amazon video and you start seeing movies you are interested in, you probably forgot to filter for movies 'included with prime'. Careful not to click on a movie you might like, as those are the ones you have to pay for

For instance if you see an original in a series, check for the prime icon in the top left. When filtered for movies available with prime, you should be seeing all sequels and Michael Bay movies.
