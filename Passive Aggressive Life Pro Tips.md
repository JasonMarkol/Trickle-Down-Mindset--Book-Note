NLP is a messy theory. Research has disproved a lot of their ideas but a good amount of ideas still stand as scientifically legitimate. Some of the things you can use are pacing and leading, mental imagery, and mirroring. However, if you are looking to use these NLP techniques to become more socially adept, I recommend studying theory (by reading books like How to Win Friends and Influence People) instead of using these ideas.
In short NLP has some valid tools but the basis of the theory is flawed. And the tools are just that, tools. So get a foundation of social skills then use them. Only learning NLP is like buying a hammer and thinking youâ€™re an architect.



# Attraction is not about what you say or do, but about who you are. You can have the coolest line in the world, but if you're a loser and are desperate to impress her, you will kill any attraction. You could say the dumbest thing in the world, but if you're a cool guy, it won't matter, in fact it will likely make her like you even more.

# You become an attractive individual by investing in yourself rather than in the women you are pursuing. Sex and women is a side effect of becoming an emotionally competent and sexually confident man, not the cause of it.

# LPT: If you're browsing amazon video and you start seeing movies you are interested in, you probably forgot to filter for movies 'included with prime'. Careful not to click on a movie you might like, as those are the ones you have to pay for

For instance if you see an original in a series, check for the prime icon in the top left. When filtered for movies available with prime, you should be seeing all sequels and Michael Bay movies.

# LPT: when someone is reading a book or studying, draw there attention by asking multiple questions about random crap. Extra points for forcing them into a conversation then being upset when they ask you to leave them alone. 

# LPT : Use earbuds with a microphone for your phone calls. Durring the call touch one of the speaker earpieces to the microphone, the person on the other line will hear either everthing they say echoed back, or a high pitched squeel sound.

# LPT: Parents, go absolutely fucking ballistic when your child comes home from school and they got a B on an assignment. It's a really good way to boost their self-confidence, improve their trust in you, and not make them actually consider suicide.

# How to handle other men coming to hit on a girl I'm *currently* talking with? 
Act unphased but amused, almost like they're shitty clowns that you're enjoying a bit. Don't try to compete, in fact overamplify them like the court jester. Separately, you should have been running solid game prior so that she's getting more emotional spikes from you already and has no interest in them to begin with. If they're unwelcome to her, she'll make clear in no uncertain terms and they'll bugger off while you're unreactive, perhaps somewhat amused, like how you'd feel if your 5 year younger immature brother was trying to impress your long term girlfriend. 


# LPT: When introducing someone to a group of people, don't say he or she is nervous or shy. That creates embarrassment and compounds the problem.

# how to quit smoking as a group of friends

Groups of friends tend to smoke together. There comes a time when part of or all the group wants to quit. Well, you can do it together using the SLAP bet!
I smoked a lot in my 20's and my group of friends and I all decided to quit together. What helped us was our "slap bet". If any of us caught one of our group of friends smoking a cigarette, EACH ONE of us could slap that person up to 3 times in the span of a month. AT ANY TIME we want (could walk in on a friend fucking and smack em if we wanted, that was part of the deal, they could be taking a shit, kick open the door, SMACK!). With that fear, I quit cold turkey and never looked back. My buddy wasn't so lucky and we found him smoking, we all gathered in a line (8+ of us) and each slapped the shit out of him. One of my slaps, I walked into his room while him and his girlfriend were asleep and I slapped him, SMACK!
It's fun. At the end of the day, it's just a slap, but it deters you when you're staring at the cigarette and imagine 30+ slaps over the next 30 days. It's a nice incentive.
Hope it works for you!
