# LPT: If you're browsing amazon video and you start seeing movies you are interested in, you probably forgot to filter for movies 'included with prime'. Careful not to click on a movie you might like, as those are the ones you have to pay for

For instance if you see an original in a series, check for the prime icon in the top left. When filtered for movies available with prime, you should be seeing all sequels and Michael Bay movies.

# LPT: when someone is reading a book or studying, draw there attention by asking multiple questions about random crap. Extra points for forcing them into a conversation then being upset when they ask you to leave them alone.
