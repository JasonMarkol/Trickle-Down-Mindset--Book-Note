- The idea that you are able to be in an uncomfortable situation - that it doesn't matter someone wants an explanation for you .

- you don't feel like you have to give a validation.

- you can sit in that uncomfortable spot.

- And you can choose to be uncomfortable .you don't have to make everything smooth and happy and everyone love you .  Allow somebody upset to you .
