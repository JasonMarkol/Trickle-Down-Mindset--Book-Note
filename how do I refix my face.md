I started mewing last year February and following the advice of some people I started hard mewing. This was a mistake as it made my jaw uneven. People told me to continue mewing but normally with no force to fix this but I was wondering if I should line my teeth up and try to keep it like that or just stick with itâ€™s natural position, mewing in both scenarios of course.
