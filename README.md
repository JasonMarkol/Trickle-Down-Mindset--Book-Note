“But I ’ ll tell you something, ” he continued, pointing at the
door, “ every employee in this company thinks I have the answers.
They think that I have a plan. I ’ ve got news for you: there really is
no grand plan. We have only partial knowledge of how it is going
to go. But if I were going to tell this to the people who work for
me, they wouldn ’ t believe it for a minute. ”

Whatever my accomplishments, all of the
things I loved were rooted in the dreams and goals I had as a child…and
in the ways I had managed to fulfill almost all of them. <br/>
Create a classroom blog that allows students to respond electronically to
questions and ideas.<br/>
Rather than using notecards, use a computer lab and display one comprehension question on each computer. Ask students to rotate around the room answering questions and making comments related to the topic.<br/>

成熟的人，以利為基礎做為判斷，反而少了情緒上的愛恨情仇。 <br/>
要別人聽你講的時候，告訴他你「要」的，而不是叫他「不要」做什麼<br/>

车辆代检是指自己的车辆无法通过年检，找关系通过，或者是在外地无法来年检，找朋友代替年检。<br/>
成功者所锻炼的“手段”，往往没有人教、或是不能教成功者<br/>

<br/>
伟人传记、名人自述绝对不会告诉你他们真正使用了哪些黑暗的手段
因为如果真正让世人知道，要嘛他们蹲牢房、要嘛增加自己被打败的几率
于是编写谎言来欺骗众人，建筑一条虚幻的道路引诱世人追随，
就是为什么大家都认为自己朝着成功迈进，却永远徒劳无功！
心地善良不会上天堂，真正该学的是驾驭魔鬼
所有的成功都有关于人性，但就没人告诉你怎么操控人性，或是不被操控! <br/>
