Contests keep listeners interested, especially when they can call in
for something free. There is a certain level of excitement when lots of
people want one thing. Look at what happens at those department
store sales where you hear that two otherwise well-behaved women
tear a garment in two in a tussle for the bargain, ruining the thing for
both of them. Really now!
