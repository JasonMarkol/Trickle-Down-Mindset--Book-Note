00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,740
Do you wanna change your life?

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,300
It's a simple question, just answer it.
Do you want to?

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,060
You want to, right?

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,840
Of course you do.

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,960
Of course you do!

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,180
Everbody does.

7
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,640
Nobody likes what's going on, okay? Ever.

8
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,200
That's my first news flash:
never nobody likes anything ever when it's happening ever.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,120
So then of course you wanna change your life, so how you gonna do it?

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,720
How are you gonna change your life?
Seriously.

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,400
Seriously ask yourself that.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,120
How?

13
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,800
How could it even be possible

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,580
for me, ME,
to change my life?

15
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,920
Okay? I used to be disgusting.

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,920
I used to be a disgusting,

17
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,180
fat,

18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,240
SUCK of a man!

19
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,740
I was an alcoholic

20
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,100
eating balls of mozzarella on a mattress on the floor!

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,240
Watching videos of people dying!

22
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,660
I was a mindless robot.

23
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,100
Y'know- not even!

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,660
Because a robot has a function!

25
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,340
I was robot shit!

26
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,840
If there was a robot designed

27
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,620
to shit scrap,
for no reason,

28
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,940
I would've been the heap of scrap

29
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,020
that came out of that robot's ass!

30
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,820
You wanna know what I did with that person?

31
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,980
You wanna know what I did with the old version of me?

32
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,540
I MURDERED HIM!

33
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,380
I murdered that man!

34
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,620
I fucked him up!

35
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,240
With an ax!

36
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,060
I left him BLEEDING and DYING

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,760
in a fucking grave

38
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,900
that I made HIM DIG!

39
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,200
Oh and I laughed.

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,400
I laughed

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,900
when he begged for his fuckin' life!

42
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
Please! Please!

43
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,660
Please, I- I- I can change!

44
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,300
I can do-

45
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,580
I'll do everything differently!

46
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,020
I can change, I can change!

47
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,980
CHANGE? 
I can change, I can change!

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,320
You can't change!

49
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,360
You can't change

50
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,500
because there is no YOU anymore!

51
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,740
And I poured gasoline on him.
(Oh my-)

52
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,140
And I lit a match and I tossed it in!

53
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,040
(Oh my god!)
And I lit a match and I tossed it in!

54
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,980
(Please, God!!)
And it set him ablaze!

55
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,140
(AAAAH!)

56
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,460
And thick
(AAAAH!)

57
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,280
black smoke covered the screams!
(AAAAAAAAAAAH!)

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,080
(AAAAAAAH!)

59
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,100
And I danced around the magnificent pyre.
(AAAAAAAH!)
And I danced around the magnificent pyre.

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,020
(AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!)

61
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,260
And I raised both my arms
(AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!)
to the heavens

62
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,540
and I shouted:
(AAAAAH!)

63
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,240
and I shouted:
(HELP MEEEE!!)

64
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,380
NOW I MAY FLY FREE!
(HELP MEEEE!!)

65
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,220
NOW I MAY FLY FREE!
(EEAAAAAH!)

66
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,280
(WAAAAAAAAAHH!)

67
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,040
And I pointed
(WAAAAAAAAAHH!)

68
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,040
one finger into the depths

69
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,920
and SCREAMED:

70
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,920
MAKE

71
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,840
THIS

72
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,860
ONE

73
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,980
SUFFER!

74
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,200
A flash a flooding light

75
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,420
Ooooh oooh ooh
yeaaaa

76
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,080
yeaaaa
In this moment,

77
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,160
yeaaaa
my mind was a needle
In this moment

78
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,200
The ashes of time

79
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,700
In this moment
The ashes of time

80
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,400
my mind was a needle
The ashes of time

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,960
my mind was a needle
my mind was a needle
The ashes of time

82
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,560
my mind was a needle
The ashes of time

83
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,620
my mind was a needle
my mind was a needle
The ashes of time

84
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,780
In this moment
 The ashes of time

85
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,740
The ashes of time

86
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,280
In this moment,

87
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,620
my senses came to me.

88
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,980
My senses came to me.

89
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,880
And I opened my eyes.

90
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,160
(And I opened my eyes.)

91
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,060
In this moment, for the first time.

92
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,460
And I opened my eyes.

93
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,640
For the first time.

94
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:16,880
Burned awaaaaaaay.
