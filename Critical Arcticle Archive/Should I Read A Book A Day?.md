# Should I Read A Book A Day?

# 摘要
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,640
like some people are going to actually
dive into this reading a book every

36
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,750
single day or every single week and read
like crazy and then they'll not taking

37
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,640
action end up just taking in too much
information and not actually taking

38
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,140
action because if you don't actually
take action on that information you are

39
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,060
essentially doing nothing you just have
all the knowledge all the material up

40
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,709
here but if you don't take action then
it's it's for nothing like it's

what's going on Jeremiah here from
Jeremiah rants and the topic today is I

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,960
wanted to talk about reading a book
every single day or reading a book every

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,280
week and this seems thanks would be
something that is pretty big in the
self-improvement community which it's

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,550
probably due to taya Lopez and his
success was saying that talking about

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,260
reading a book every single day and how
that seems to grab the tension but it's

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,250
like the thing about is that like I'm
not against reading books like if you

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,690
can read a book a week or a book every
single day that's entirely up to you

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:43,170
but a lot of these gurus and other guys
they end up talking about speed reading

9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,820
which basically means you're not
actually reading in the book and on top

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,390
of that really and truly most of these
books out here they're not even really

11
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,039
worth reading like you really only read
one or two books in that category and

12
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,789
you've essentially read them all like
they're just the same thing it's just a

13
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,700
ton of fluff so it seems to me like for
the most part the reading a book a day

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,680
or reading a book every single week and
someone bragging about this seems to be

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,509
more like marketing like it's like
they're just marketing it's like look at

16
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,840
me I read a book every single day every
single week take advice from me they it

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,830
just seems kind of weird to me reading
books and everything does have its

18
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,909
purpose but as I said most books really
truly aren't really worth reading

19
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,619
they're just the same thing just
repeating over and over and over again

20
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:43,200
and you know it's like it's just a fad
in the community basically you know it's

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,189
like with me it's like I actually do
read quite a bit but if it's a book or
maybe I'll be halfway through the book

22
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,310
and it's actually not that great and it
doesn't have that much value in it I'll

23
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,880
just quit reading it like I just
randomly could quit reading it like

24
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,259
you're not going to anything out of it
it's not really worth reading

25
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,969
so essentially people are probably just
trying to use this so they can get

26
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,290
affiliate links and marketing
and all that so you'll click on their

27
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,910
little affiliate links you know which
I'll probably eventually have my own

28
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:20,310
Amazon affiliate links in the future but
for right now I don't so reading books

29
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,170
or listening to audiobooks is great and
everything but you still yet need to
take action like one of the best

30
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,620
examples would be if you get someone
who's overweight and they just watch the

31
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,270
videos read articles read books about
health fitness diet and how to lose

32
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,680
weight yet they never lose weight like
they're still yet overweight they're

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,970
still we as struggling with that the
thing about is that you have to actually

34
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,160
take actually you have to actually make
shit happen and people just give it's

35
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,640
like some people are going to actually
dive into this reading a book every

36
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,750
single day or every single week and read
like crazy and then they'll not taking

37
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,640
action end up just taking in too much
information and not actually taking

38
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,140
action because if you don't actually
take action on that information you are

39
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,060
essentially doing nothing you just have
all the knowledge all the material up

40
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,709
here but if you don't take action then
it's it's for nothing like it's

41
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:22,110
literally for nothing it's not going to
benefit you it's not going to like do

42
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,240
anything into the world or in your life
if you don't apply it and actually take

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,380
action and not to mention it's like with
something like making new habits or

44
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,000
losing weight like you have to basically
get those disciplines you have to get

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,760
those habits you have to actually
exercise and eat better it's not just

46
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,080
reading about it you know it's like
you're saying I'm reading how to lose

47
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,860
weight you're not going to lose weight
but it's like not that you know reading

48
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,060
about is necessarily bad just that you
have to take action because there are

49
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,140
people who are going just read read read
read read watch a video after video
after video and not take any action not

50
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,280
do anything and I think this is actually
something that needs to be said because

51
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,480
like all these gurus they're just like
oh I read all these books I read a ton

52
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,320
of books like click on my Amazon
affiliate links and it's like they don't

53
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,700
they're not like hey you know you need
to actually take action

54
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,720
in these books you need to actually read
books that challenge your beliefs

55
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,790
they're just like oh this book made me
feel good read this book but either way

56
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,740
it goes it's up for you to decide do
your own research find out you know if

57
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,940
you think that what I'm saying is
actually fairly legitimate or not it's

58
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:41,480
entirely up to you take it or leave it
