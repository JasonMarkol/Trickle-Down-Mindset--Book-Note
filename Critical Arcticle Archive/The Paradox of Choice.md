this shows that more can actually be
less people get confused with too many
choices let's say I create a video about

29
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,980
healthy smoothies and I give you a list
of my favorite blenders if I gave you 20

30
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,880
different types of blenders even if all
of them are really good you might end up

31
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,020
not buying at all because there are too
many options but if I gave you two or

32
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,860
three types of good blenders maybe for
different purposes or different sizes

33
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,720
you are more likely to buy one of them
I'm not saying choices are a bad thing
after all it is nice to live in a

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,680
diverse world with so many opportunities
but it is important to know how to deal

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,240
with these choices or happiness want to
be harmed we need to take advantage of

36
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,170
the power we have to make choices and
use it for our benefit instead of
letting it stresses so how can you

37
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,940
overcome the paradox of choice the more
choices we have the greater the need

# The Paradox of Choice - The Problem With Too Many Choices

1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,279
[Music]
every morning they stand in front of me

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,900
close it and choose what I'm going to
wear today I have many clothes but

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,210
somehow I end up wearing only a few of
them sound familiar it's like when you

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,830
go to a restaurant and read the menu
trying to choose what to order but there
are so many options and you don't know

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,369
what to choose many times you make a
decision or there's something but end up

6
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,720
regretting that you didn't order the
other dish we make decisions like this

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,300
many times in our lives when we choose a
career a partner or even what present we

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,370
should buy for someone's birthday this
is the paradox of choice why is it a

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,079
paradox well it makes sense to think
that the more choices we have the

10
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,000
happier we'll become but the opposite is
the truth in most cases too many options

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,930
can be stressful and bring more
negativity than happiness and freedom

12
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,270
this is called analysis paralysis and it
is the state of over analyzing or

13
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,589
overthinking the situation so that a
decision or action is never taken in

14
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,150
effect paralyzing the outcome what
happens actually is that you are

15
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,470
presented with options you need to make
a decision so you choose something and

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,670
after the choice was made you started
doubted and then the overthinking comes

17
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,799
what if I chose the other option you
blame yourself for the decision you made

18
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,820
and end up feeling worse because if you
didn't have the option to choose you
couldn't blame yourself when few are the

19
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,829
ones in control you feel responsible for
the results I know it sounds pessimistic

20
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,509
but wait till the end of the video I
promise it gets better in his book the

21
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,310
paradox of choice Barry Schwartz talks
about an amazing study sometimes called

22
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,220
the Jam experiment a grocery store in
California set a jam sample booth

23
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:54,479
sometimes with 24 types of jam and
sometimes with only 6 flavors and every

24
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,310
person who came to the booth was given a
$1 coupon to purchase Jam the results

25
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,060
are amazing when the 24 flavors were
displayed 145 people stopped by but only

26
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,760
four of them made a purchase however
when the six flavors were presented less

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,710
people stopped
104 but 31 of them bought gem

28
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,540
this shows that more can actually be
less people get confused with too many

36
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,170
the power we have to make choices and
use it for our benefit instead of
letting it stresses so how can you

37
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,940
overcome the paradox of choice the more
choices we have the greater the need for

38
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,400
focus being conscious of it is a great
start you're already more than halfway

39
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,870
there we know that there is no point to
ponder too much and obsessively think

40
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,820
about what is what I personally do is a
try to eliminate my options by

41
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,770
prioritizing once a year I get rid of
the clothes I don't wear so I have less

42
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,940
to choose from and of course the fact
that my closet is more organized helps a

43
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,580
lot another example is that I always
have so many ideas and things I want to

44
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,840
do but not enough time to do everything
it's very hard to choose what to focus

45
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,490
on so I sit down and make a list of all
the things they want to do and then I

46
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,030
prioritize them and dedicate more time
to these things that are more important

47
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,010
if I have too many items on the list I
have to give up on some of them and do

48
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,390
it maybe in another time in most cases
the choices you make are not

49
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,380
unchangeable you can try something and
then decide to change your mind that's

50
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,780
fine but if you can't change it accept
it instead of feeling story try to stand

51
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,550
by the choices you make even if you
could choose something better

52
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,600
