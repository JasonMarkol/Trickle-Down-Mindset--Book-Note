# 摘要

I saw that that was not really bringing
me long term happiness so I decided to

11
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,629
change my focus and I started going to
the gym reading more books eventually
creating a business and I eventually

12
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,670
started becoming good at other stuff
let's say you watch a lot of movies okay

13
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,250
you have two options you can either
follow that path and maybe create a

14
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,920
YouTube channel where you make movie
reviews you start making money out of it

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,799
okay that's fulfillment out of it or if
you feel that it's not your purpose it's

16
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,840
not your real passion you start putting
your focus and other stuff okay maybe

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,150
you kind of like gravy you start going
to wring the classes okay maybe you kind

18
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,680
of like the idea of creating a certain
business you start reading more about

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,560
that business okay and I guarantee you
if you start putting time and focus on

20
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,939
something you will eventually get good
things out of it
okay so at any point during your life

21
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,290
you are good at something okay stop that
idea that you are a loser

people ask themselves even I used to ask

myself at some point during my life
which is am i a loser okay maybe you go

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,340
on social media and you see all these
people being successful achieving cool

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,750
stuff on life maybe they are even
younger than you and you are like what

that's the case I think you should think

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,130
about it this way maybe you are not
putting your Ian's energy into the right

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,260

games okay but guess what I was really
good at them okay I until at some point
