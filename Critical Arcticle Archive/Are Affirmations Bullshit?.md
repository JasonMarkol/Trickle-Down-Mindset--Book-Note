Jeremih here from jeremiah rent.com and
today i'm going to talk about

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,139
affirmations so the thing about is that
first off with affirmations i don't

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,580
think that they are complete bullshit
but i think that's the way most people

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,380
will use them is actually complete
bullshit and what i mean by this is that

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,750
they'll just stand there and they'll
just give themselves affirmations and

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,920
say these affirmations that make them
feel good or try to like manifest money

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,719
and try to do some law of attraction but
they don't actually take any action so

8
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,200
what happens is they're just saying
they're just setting they're saying all

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,520
of these positive things to themselves
which this isn't necessarily bad which

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,480
I'll get into later on in the video but
the thing about it is that when you do
that you don't take action like your

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,059
minds literally going to be like you're
bullshitting yourself your minds not

12
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,110
gonna believe you unless if you actually
go out there and take action if you sit

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,879
there like oh I'm a great guy and all
this other shit it's like if you don't

14
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,359
actually take action actually prove to
yourself that you're a great guy if

15
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,040
you're saying that telling yourself oh
I'm this great wonderful guy everybody's

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,180
you know everybody's gonna like me and
it's like you just like set it home like

17
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,009
you know masturbating all fucking day
then it's like you like your minds gonna

18
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,920
be like bullshit it's like you have to
actually prove it to yourself you know

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,930
you have to actually go out do shit
actually prove it to yourself otherwise

20
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,890
your bullshit detector in your mind is
gonna go off and it's weird because a

21
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,670
lot of people seem to actually miss out
on this and they seem to just fall into

22
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,110
like affirmations and maybe even like
subliminals and whatnot and be like oh

23
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,640
I'm going to just do this and it's gonna
you know develop me and they're not

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,360
gonna take any action not do anything it
doesn't really work that way it's just

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,070
marketing you know the guys who make
videos about like they're just marketing

26
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,899
like let's be real you know it's kind of
like the other video that I actually

27
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,990
made before this one which was about
reading a book a day and whatnot and how

28
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,860
people end up not taking action how
taking actions a very important part of

29
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,770
actually
eating and getting knowledge I would

30
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,519
suggest that you actually check out that
video I'll link it down below you know

31
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,110
back to affirmations I do think there is
actually a big benefit because I used to

32
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,160
do them not so much now but one great
thing about them is that if you have
like in your mind like you're really

33
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,069
negative about yourself like you have a
low self-image of yourself if you start

34
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,569
using affirmations especially if you do
something like really cool you're just

35
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:42,209
like man I'm awesome like that was this
shit I'm fucking cool and you do that

36
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,980
and you kind of just keep playing that
in your mind like there actually is some

37
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,500
benefits to it like it will actually
make you feel better and like the thing

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,890
about is that the bigger issue the
bigger point when it comes to this is

39
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,720
that instead of like your normal
behavior in your mind like maybe you'll

40
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,530
put yourself down you'll be like oh I'm
losing or wherever it may be instead you

41
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,130
make it more positive so instead of all
the self hey there's like a little bit

42
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,239
more self-love and it's more positive
and then you make yourself feel better

43
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,950
and in a way it's like instead of your
mind just going to the default because
your mind will just keep going to the

44
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:23,910
default which is I'm a loser I'm not
good like I'm bad whatever it may be and

45
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,569
you just and then basically you just
have to practice and it's gonna take a

46
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:32,489
long time like this will take forever
like you'll literally do this for like

47
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:38,250
six or nine months and it's like you
still yet like and you still yet you

48
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,019
still have a way to go and it's like
what happened is like a bath all come to

49
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,130
your head like man I'm a loser or
whatever it may be and then it's like

50
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,420
you kind of just catch it and you make
it more positive which at the same time

51
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,480
it's like if you're saying they're doing
nothing and your minds like man I'm a

52
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,549
loser I'm just sitting here watching TV
eight hours a day and then you know it's

53
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,380
like there actually is some benefit to
that because that can actually motivate

54
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,609
you being like oh you're fucking loser
you don't fucking do shit you need to

55
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:10,620
get off your fucking ass you're a piece
of shit

56
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,970
you're a fat piece of shit like that can
actually motivate you a lot like if you

57
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,359
look at yourself you see your own
bullshit and it's like holy SH I need to

58
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,129
actually
do something but otherwise like actually

59
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,510
getting some that negativity out of your
mind and some of those unnecessary like

60
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,580
negative like self hate thoughts it's
like a wonderful thing to do but it

61
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,530
takes a long time and it might not be
quite as simple as a setting standing in

62
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,190
the marriage the same affirmations to
yourself like you have to catch this on

63
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,570
a daily basis as it comes up in your
mind and in the beginning it might

64
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,060
actually be harder like these thoughts
might go through your mind you won't

65
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,810
catch them but after time you'll start
catching them and then it's like you're

66
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,520
just like automatically just reverse
them and make it more positive and you

67
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,590
know that's it's pretty great but you
know otherwise that's the video let me
