Stress triggers our fight-flight system, meaning whatever's stressing you out will be seen as an enemy by our brains. So, please just stay calm when trying to recruit a good habit to join your party.
For example, eating non-starchy veggies. Just eat them calmly.

Especially, the folks who automatically feel nauseous even over just the very idea of eating veggies. Unfortunately, such have become "classically conditioned" by media and society that vegetables are disgusting which means that their brains think veggies = poison. The only way to reverse THIS horror is to eat veggies calmly so the wrong conditioning can be erased.
FYI, vegetarians LOVE eating veggies. They're not suffering or trying to force themselves to eat veggies.

They actually enjoy eating vegetables.

Same goes for any good habit. People who exercise a lot are ADDICTED to exercise. People who love cleaning house LOVE doing chores. Book worms... they don't need virtual reality gear... The budgeteers... probably feel giddy whenever they update their spreadsheets or whichever budgeting app they use.
Personally, I've come to loathe hot showers. Cold showers for me, please.

Good habits are not just means to whatever rewards you are after - they literally become sources of enjoyment by themselves but only IF you do not stress over doing them.
