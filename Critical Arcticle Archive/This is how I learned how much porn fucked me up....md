I went to a legal brothel in Pahrump, NV. Full virgin. They lined up 7 beautiful ladies in front of me, and guess what? I didn't think a single one was attractive. Not one of them was good enough to fit my standards. I ended up leaving without doing anything, and feeling like shit. In fact, one of them kinda scoffed when they walked out, as if saying "wow".
I'll never forget that moment, but I don't want to either. I learned a valuable lesson. That by watching porn, my standards shot through the roof. No girl will ever be good enough for me so long as I keep only looking for the girls that fit my taste. See, with a computer, it's different, because if you don't like the naked woman you see, then it's ok, because there are hundreds of thousands of others that are just a click away. In the real world, it's much different. You can't just click through women until you find the piece of meat that you want, then slap a personality on them that you like and hit the "go" button.
This only just happened a few weeks ago, so I barely understand what the coping process is or how things are going to change, but it's something I have to do.
