# Business ideas are overrated
# - focus on positioning,execution,consistency.
# No product first -  Consulting - training - coaching  - Reverse engineer the process to create the "product".

# First is Allways start with the client in mind - Who is the person I help with ? what I can give ? 

# Any challenge you've been through can help people! 你的经验 > 对方 >对方正好困于某个问题 

This takes into consideration: 

1) What are you good at? What challenges have you overcome in your life that other people mind find themselves in right now? This can be your business idea in 2019 if you now figure out the next step. 

2) Who is your target audience and how can you sell them your business idea? Study your target audience, get in touch with them, craft an offer

3) that's your actual business idea that makes money. Now that you have the offer, validate it with test clients, start making money, learn on the fly, perfect the offer and the value you're giving to your clients with your business idea.
