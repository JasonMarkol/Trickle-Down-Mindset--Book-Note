Ask yourself, when beginning a printed discussion, What am I looking for? What is the author going to talk
about? Often this will be indicated in topical headings. Keep it in the background of your mind while reading,
and search for the answer. Then, when you have read the necessary portion, close the book and summarize, to
see if the author furnished what you sought. In short, always read for a purpose. Formulate problems and seek
their solutions. In this way will there be direction in your reading and your thought.<br/>

This discussion of reading notes has turned into an essay on "How to Read," and you must be convinced by
this time that there is much to learn in this respect, so much that we may profitably spend more time in
discussing it.<br/>

Every book you take up should be opened with some preliminary ceremony. This does not refer to the
physical operation of opening a new book, but to the mental operation. In general, take the following steps:
<br/>
1. Observe the title. See exactly what field the book attempts to cover.<br/>
2. Observe the author's name. If you are to use his book frequently, discover his position in the field.<br/>
Remember, you are going to accept him as authority, and you should know his status. You may be told this on
the title-page, or you may have to consult Who's Who, or the biographical dictionary.
3. Glance over the preface. Under some circumstances you should read it carefully. If you are going to refer to
the book very often, make friends with the author; let him introduce himself to you; this he will do in the
preface. Observe the date of publication, also, in order to get an idea as to the recency of the material.
<br/>
4. Glance over the table of contents. If you are very familiar with the field, and the table of contents is
outlined in detail, you might advantageously study it and dispense with reading the book. On the other hand, if
you are going to consult the book only briefly, you might find it necessary to study the table of contents in
order to see the relation of the part you read to the entire work.<br/>

5. Use the index intelligently; it may save you much time.<br/>
------------------------------------------

Exercise 1. Contrast the taking of notes from reading and from lectures.<br/>
Exercise 2. Make an outline of this chapter.<br/>
Exercise 3. Make an outline of some lecture.<br/>
Exercise 1. Draw a picture of the brain, showing roughly what takes place there (a) when you read a book, (6)
listen to a lecture, (c) take notes.<br/>

In writing themes, the principle of distribution of time may also be profitably employed. After you have once
written a theme, lay it aside for a while--perhaps a week. Then when you take it up, read it in a detached
manner and you will note many places where it may be improved. These benefits are to be enjoyed only when
a theme is planned a long time ahead. Hence the rule to start as early as possible.
