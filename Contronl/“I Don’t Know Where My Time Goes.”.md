Think about the next seven
days, starting with tomorrow. Using the blank un-schedule on pages
198–199 as a model, write down all of the activities you can predict
you will do in the coming week, however trivial they may seem. Mark
on your un-schedule the hours when you most probably will be doing things you already know will occur in the next week. If you know
exactly when you will be doing something, write it down in the appropriate box—for example, a lunch meeting, Tuesday, 12:00–1:30
P.
M. If you don’t know exactly when you will do something, estimate
the amount of time it will take and then mark it down on a day when
you might do it. Include any special commitments you have scheduled for this week, like an evening meeting or a social date. In addition, mark off time for routine activities, such as grocery shopping or
filling the gas tank of your car, that happen each week. <br/>

Consider the whole variety of activities in your life: work hours;
scheduled meetings and appointments; classes and social events; time
for exercise; time for meals, including preparation and cleanup; time
given to household chores such as cleaning, laundry, and shopping;
time set aside to spend with your friends, spouse, or children; time that
you spend sleeping. If you always watch the evening news, Monday Night Football, or other favorite television programs, put them down as
well. Anticipate the extra time you spend reading the newspaper on
Sundays. Don’t forget to include your commuting and travel time, too.
Use a calendar to remind yourself of your commitments, because it’s
easy to forget something. It’s hubris to think you can keep track of
everything in your head. On pages 200–201 is the un-schedule for
Sonya, a high school history teacher who is behind on grading midterm
papers for her students. <br/>

Remember, we are not asking you to write down what you should
be doing. Don’t put down when you hope you’ll get around to starting on your behavioral goal or when you think you’ll send an e-mail
to your old friend. If you are a student, don’t put down the times
when you hope you’ll be doing your homework. We are not asking
you to promise yourself to try to do anything extra; we are only asking you to acknowledge what times are already spoken for in the
coming week. <br/>

When you have finished filling out the un-schedule, look it over.
This page represents your life for the next week. When you project
yourself into the next seven days, how do you feel? Are you overwhelmed by all you are going to do? Anxious about how you are
going to fill your uncommitted time? Depressed because you have so
little free time? Examine how you feel as you visualize yourself going
through this week, and consider what it is about your schedule that
leads you to feel that way. <br/>

What can you learn about how much time you have available to
work on your project? The un-schedule shows you the maximum
amount of time you could use; the blank spaces reflect all of your uncommitted hours. Of course, no one will use all of the uncommitted
hours to work on a project, but the un-schedule shows you how
much time is potentially available. <br/>

A design engineer selected delivering a design to his client as his
one-week behavioral goal, and he planned to spend three hours a day
working on his project. When he filled out his un-schedule, he saw
that he didn’t even have three uncommitted hours a day! Given his present schedule, his goal was unattainable. By underestimating how
much of his time was already spoken for, he was setting himself up
for failure. He either had to revise his goal or revise his schedule. <br/>

Perhaps you are one of those people who have a lot of unscheduled time. Many people who work from home or work part-time or
who are self-employed or unemployed find that they face large blocks
of unstructured time. For procrastinators, this “free” time can generate a lot of anxiety, because it means they have to create their own
structure in order to get anything done. <br/>

The un-schedule can also tell you something about how you are
currently managing your time. A brilliant graduate student did not
realize until he filled out his un-schedule that waking up at 8:50 for a
9:00 A.M. class was cutting it too close. No wonder he was always late
for everything! <br/>

Sometimes people examine their commitments and discover how
much of their time is taken up with social engagements and recreation. These procrastinators have planned their excuses ahead of
time, so that when the moment comes, they feel they are meeting
their obligations, and they may not recognize that they’re procrastinating. “I keep planning so many social events after work that I never
even have to decide if I’m going to start writing my book or not,” said
a magazine editor. “I just barely have time to get where I’m going.” <br/>

Look closely at your un-schedule. Is there anything missing from
your life? Some procrastinators don’t allow themselves any recreation; since they’re always behind, they feel they don’t deserve any
downtime. And those who do hop from one recreational event to another may not experience genuine pleasure in their frenetic activity if
they are using fun events to escape their work. Amy, a realtor, realized, “I haven’t included any fun! I feel so guilty about all the work I
have to do that I don’t think I should take any time out just to enjoy
myself. No wonder I’m so tense all the time.” <br/>

Some procrastinators schedule too much socializing and leave out
time to be alone. Others withdraw from people and allow themselves
too little social contact. What have you scheduled too little of? Time
with your family? With friends? Physical activity? Leisurely reading?
