# Dig deep
There’s always a reason not to do something. The truth is for many
of us, life can be hard at times, but this is when we have to dig deep
and push forward. We have to move away from our comfort zone and
create solutions where none seem to exist.<br/>

J.K. Rowling was a single mum when she wrote Harry Potter.
Not only that, but she had to face being turned down by countless
publishers before one would believe in her. It would have been much
easier for her to have said, “I’m a single mum, I just don’t have the
money or time to do this,” but she didn’t.<br/>

And where is she now? A billionaire fulflling her life’s ambitions of
being one of the most successful authors of all time.<br/>

Yes, it is harder if you are a single parent or have challenging family
commitments, but there is a big difference between “harder” and
impossible.<br/>

You have to do whatever it takes and don’t give up. Find another single
mum (or dad) to share childcare with, work nights, fnd something you
can do working from home in the frst instance. Whatever you do, it
probably won’t be what you want to do, but it’s not supposed to be –
it’s supposed to be a stepping stone to get you where you want to go.

Many people have a different type of family commitment – obligation.
Parents want the best for their children, but this can often mean
pushing them down a path that isn’t for them.<br/>
How many people do you know who are in careers because at some
point in their life they thought it would please their parents, spouse,
career teacher or society?<br/>
We have to be true to ourselves whilst managing these obstacles
sensitively. Explain and prove to those that love you that following
your own path doesn’t mean a life of debauchery and destitution; OK,
you may not do the Ph.D. or become a doctor, but you’re going to be
happy and fulflled and ultimately that’s all any parent wants – even if
they can’t always see it at the time.<br/>
Then there’s the age-old excuse of…age. Too young, too old.
Jordan Romero was 9 when he climbed Kilimanjaro.<br/>
Colonel Sanders was 40 before he started cooking his famous chicken
– out of his dining room! And it wasn’t until he was 65 that he started
franchising one of the world’s most famous fast food restaurants,
Kentucky Fried Chicken.<br/>
You can always fnd an excuse, but you can always fnd an inspiration
too.<br/>
If man can land on the moon, there’s not much you can’t do once
you’ve made your mind up and moved from talking about it to actually
doing it

So get resourceful. Accept the fact that you may have more challenges
than most. It happens. But you have just the same chance of success.
Give up the TV. Wake up an hour earlier. Steal time from wherever
you can. Enlist the help and support of all your family and friends.
Make a public commitment to your goals and not only will it give
you an extra impetus to achieve them but it also gathers support and
momentum behind you.
And as we explain on page 192, holding yourself publicly accountable
is proven to greatly increase your chance of success.
So keep digging, digging, digging, digging…
