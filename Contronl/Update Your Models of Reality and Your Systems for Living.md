# Update Your Models of Reality and Your Systems for Living

“Extraordinary minds understand that their growth depends on two things: their models of reality and their systems for living. They carefully curate the most empowering models and systems and frequently update themselves.”

<br/>

The growth of your life depends on two things:<br/>
<br/>
Your models of reality (which is another word for beliefs)<br/>
Your systems for living (which is another word for habits and daily activities)<br/>

If you want to grow as a person – maybe you want to become more confident, better-looking, more successful, financially richer, etc. – you need to regularly update your beliefs and your habits and daily activities.
