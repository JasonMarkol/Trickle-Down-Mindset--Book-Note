Start with a blank sheet of paper and a felt tipped pen.
Be bold! <br/>
● Write the subject of your introspection in a word or short phrase
at the center of the blank page and draw a circle around it. Make
it small enough so there is plenty of room to write around it on the
page.<br/>
● Draw spokes out from the circle as you write down any words
or phrases that come to your mind about the subject.<br/>
● Just riff, let it flow, do not over-think it, or get into analyzing
and organizing; that comes later.<br/>
● If some word or concept has sub-themes that pop into your
head, just draw spokes out from that word and jot down the
related topics. If those sub-themes are big topics on their own, jot
them on a fresh sheet of paper to be mapped separately.<br/>
● When you slow down on one topic, just start a new map on the
next topic. If a thought pops up relevant to a previous map, go
back and add it to that map while it is fresh in your mind.
