# The Foundation of Free Choice

You may be in your foxhole right now and finally open to a game
changer. Or perhaps you have always been a daring delver and are now
forging into your next frontier. Anyway, you are beginning to ask the
pertinent questions, which is solid evidence that you are progressing.
This constitutes the first step of introspection. You will need to exercise
introspection throughout the entire journey of your life. It is essential to
the process of distinguishing between your lower, human-animal driven
impulses, and the inspiration and guidance ever arising from your deepest Self. As long as you are in a human body, you will always have
these opposing forces vying for your attention and loyalty. Before you
can choose between them, you have to know what you are dealing with.
If you do not become aware of these subconscious undercurrents, you
remain a slave to them.
<br/>
Introspection, then, is the prerequisite to free choice and discriminative
wisdom. It begins simply in the act of purposefully facing what IS as you
go through your day. 
<br/>
What kind of mind games are you playing? What
thoughts and feelings are drawn onto the field? How are you reacting in
the different situations that arise? What character traits are at play?
Which ones are winning? It can be downright embarrassing sometimes
to expose what is going on behind the scenes and see how controlled
you can be by knee-jerk thoughts and emotions. It takes courage to be
brutally honest with yourself, but it is worth any collateral discomfort.
<br/>
The alternative is to remain trapped in loops of habitual programming.
Taking introspective inventory is the first step in breaking free.
<br/>
Deeper introspection requires stepping back from the fray and regularly
giving yourself quiet time and space to explore further, not only into the
themes of your daily inner struggles, but more and more into your higher
aspirations. The process becomes increasingly about knowing where you
want to go and how to get there; clarifying your goals and identifying the
specific action steps needed for navigating by the polestars of your
noblest visions.
<br/>
So the art of introspection is HUGE! The resulting self-awareness
enables you to weed the garden of your life and clear the way for
cultivating the behaviors and practices that will make you into the person
you aspire to be. All the other skills necessary for accessing and
expressing your higher faculties are built upon this foundation. The
exercise below will help give structure to your self-exploration and begin
priming the pump of your Self-awareness…the source of all your
answers.

Below are instructions for an introspection technique that is simple and
useful at any stage of your process. I have found it extremely effective
over the years, both for myself (it is helping me write this book), and in
working with clients. The method is borrowed from a business
management tool called mind mapping. It works so well, because it
reflects how the mind actually engages any subject; through webs of
association. It allows you to quickly get into print your many thoughts
on a given subject, without the pressure of immediately organizing or
prioritizing them all, but in a way that has an intuitive logic and order. It
naturally draws out relevant issues, reveals hidden patterns, highlights
the important themes, suggests creative options, and facilitates focused
action planning.


# Technique one  :Mind map 

Start with a blank sheet of paper and a felt tipped pen.
Be bold! <br/>
● Write the subject of your introspection in a word or short phrase
at the center of the blank page and draw a circle around it. Make
it small enough so there is plenty of room to write around it on the
page.<br/>
● Draw spokes out from the circle as you write down any words
or phrases that come to your mind about the subject.<br/>
● Just riff, let it flow, do not over-think it, or get into analyzing
and organizing; that comes later.<br/>
● If some word or concept has sub-themes that pop into your
head, just draw spokes out from that word and jot down the
related topics. If those sub-themes are big topics on their own, jot
them on a fresh sheet of paper to be mapped separately.<br/>
● When you slow down on one topic, just start a new map on the
next topic. If a thought pops up relevant to a previous map, go
back and add it to that map while it is fresh in your mind.

<br/>
Have fun with the following exercise. Much of what emerges will be
familiar to you, but there will also be surprises. You will find certain
topics stick out to you; dig further in by making separate maps of them.
As you gradually relax your analytic mind and let the process take its
natural course, deeper layers emerge that give you valuable insights into
yourself. Save the maps for later; they will be used in the on-going
process of building your action plan.

# Exercise One: Love/Hate Introspection
Do mind maps for each of the following four topics:

<br/>What I love. <br/>

Get started on a positive note. Pour out your heart. Include
everything and everyone, no matter how silly or secret or
shallow or deep. Nothing that comes to your mind is irrelevant.

<br/>What I hate. <br/> 

Take the lid off, let it rip. Same as above; do not hold back or
edit yourself. Be as crass or sacrilegious or un-PC as you want. If
it is in there, you want to see what it looks like without any makeup.
<br/>
What is not working. 
<br/>
When facing the need for change, it can be easier to first identify
what you feel is not working in your life. Give expression to all
your frustrations and worries, to anything you want changed;
about circumstances, about other people, and about yourself.
<br/>What is working.<br/>

This is really a gratitude map by another name. Jot down
everything in your life that is supportive, inspiring, and
functioning well; all that is good in your life; in your world, in
the people around you, and in yourself.
