Fear, Confidence, and Anger

To manage is to foresee.
This was the mantra of Harvard Business School professor Georges F.
Doriot. To manage anything better, he would say, you must try to see what
is ahead—maybe not years ahead, but in the near term. What is around
the corner? How will change affect the things that matter to you?
Foreseeing emotions is as important in managing as foreseeing events.
Maybe more important.
Is your boss likely to say something to you today that will set you off?
What possible fears and concerns will your co-workers have for not meeting their commitments? How will this affect you? What possible unexpressed anger is behind the work slowdown you’ve observed from your
staff recently? What have you done or not done that may have caused
this?
Being able to look ahead (and back) sets us apart from the other animals (that and our opposable thumb). A wolf doesn’t visualize how he will
get his next meal as we may visualize an upcoming job interview. He doesn’t analyze why he missed that last rabbit as we may a lost sale. He just gets
hungry and he hunts.
The wolf has emotions, of course. But he doesn’t think about them,
deal with them, reflect on their consequences. He reacts.
Thinking about emotions—ours and the people we try to persuade—
understanding these emotions, foreseeing their likely occurrence, and acting to manage and direct these emotions can determine whether we get it
in our life’s negotiations.
Some highly respected authorities think that our emotions are like a
cold. They just come over us and all we can do is treat the symptoms. Planning emotions, they think, is like trying to control a sneeze.
It is possible to anticipate and create conditions that are optimal for
the emotions you wish to experience. It’s not simple. You have to practice.
But it’s worth the effort.
It will help, first, to learn more about emotions.
