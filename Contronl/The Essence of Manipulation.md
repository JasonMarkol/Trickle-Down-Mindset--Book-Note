# "I DON'T NEED YOU. YOU NEED ME?

I-IARDY BLEW INTO Houston, Texas, chasing the easy
money that flooded the town during the 1973 oil
boom. Being the ultimate con artist, he had never
sustained a full month of work in his life. All of his
jobs were punctuated with periods of drunkenness
when he failed to show up. Needless to say, Hardy's
working habits didn't lend themselves to a great deal
of job security. And as a result he'd bounced around
and sold just about everything: stock, land, cars, and
various and sundry items house-to-house.
<br/>
Intemperance more often saps geniuses than it does
lesser lights, and I believe this was Hardy's problem. After all, he could only be called a genius as a
manipulator. Many times I've seen him work one
week at a selling job and make more than any of his
fellow workers earned in a month. <br/>

For instance, during the last full week I saw him
put in, he made almost $2,000 in commissions before
getting fired for hitting the bottle. Sober, he could
manipulate the meanest man into following him
around like a puppy in a matter of minutes.
Only a few days after we met, I invited him to
share my apartment, because we could fill each
other's needs. He needed a place to crash when he
was drunk, and I needed someone to teach me the art
of manipulation.<br/>
During the months we lived together, he taught
me more about handling people than I had learned in
all my previous years combined. And despite the fact
that he took me for a few hundred dollars, I would
still say that Hardy pretty closely embodies the "con
man with a heart of gold" idea. The knowledge he patiently imparted to me has proven of far greater value
than the amount he cost me.<br/>
The last time I saw my friend, he was trying to con
a rich woman into marrying him. He got drunk and
disappeared shortly after that, and 1 haven't heard
from him since. But the tactics he taught stayed with
me and serve as the mainstay of this book.<br/>


# The "I don't need you" state of mind

The most essential of the tactics he taught me
amounts to a state of mind that largely determines
the success or failure of a manipulator. The entire
time you engage a person in manipulation, you must
subtly convey the idea that "I don't need you; you 
need me." This is the essence of handling people. You
tilt the bargaining table your way the minute you let
the other person get wind of your independent attitude.
This tactic applies to your love life as surely as it
does to your business activities. For instance, I've already mentioned that Hardy used the "I don't need
you" ruse on women. And he applied it so smoothly
that he confidently paid for a motel room before he
entered a bar to pick up women. It never occurred to
him that he might strike out. And to the best of my
knowledge, he almost never did. I doubt that any of
the money he paid in advance for a room was ever
wasted.

<br/>
Women, however, should bear in mind that this
tactic works both ways. And many a woman has also
manipulated men by adopting the "I don't need you;
you need me" stance. <br/>

Hardy described the tactic this way: "The person
with the upper hand in any situation is the one who
can afford to walk away from the deal if it's not to his
liking, or the one who can make the other person
think he can walk away. Make him think that you
don't need him, but that he needs you. The man who
can't do this won't get what he wants out of a deal."
A very good psychological reason exists for the
power of this tactic. Being human, we act very stubborn when we sense that someone needs something
from us. 
<br/>
This instinct is etched into every person's
psyche. If your manipulatee senses that you need him
to do things your way, his marrow-deep instincts
scream, "Don't do it!" He sets his mental brakes, and
almost nothing short of ramming him with a Greyhound bus can move him from his obstinate position.
But if you can make him believe that you don't
need him to do things your way nearly as badly as he
needs it, you've put his human nature on your side.
Now he thinks he wants what you're proposing. 

<br/>
Sohis instincts prick his ears up and make him receptive
to your ideas. By exploiting this human weakness,
you can control him nearly like a puppet.
Remember, never give the slightest hint of desperation; instead, radiate confidence and independence.
Show your antagonist how he needs what you
propose, and indicate that it makes little difference to
you which way he decides. Subtly convey that if his
terms aren't to your liking, you can simply walk
away from the deal-even when this isn't really the
case. If you smooth-talk him into this state of mind,
he'll usually want to do things your way as much as
you do.

# How this tactic applies to your love life

"Women may not whistle the tune as often, but
they need the sheet music almost as bad as men do.
They're just smarter than men about gettin' it."
(Hardy)
I've heard Hardy say many times that women
carryon the biggest con game of them all in the bedroom. "Hell, they keep men pawing all over 'em by
pretending they don't need sex. They make men
want it by acting like they don't. It's all a slick con."
Close examination of women's sexual behavior
does indicate that women often use the "I don't need
you" tactic. They most naturally fall into the "}
don't need you" sexual pattern because of a don'teven-think-about-it sexual upbringing, coupled with
a fear of being hurt. This leads most women to discourage men's first advances. As a result, they unkno\vingly mimic the "I don't need you" technique
with devastating effects, simply by spurning men's
overtures.
When a woman turns down a man's sexual advances, it usually ignites his human nature because it
implies, "I don't need you." He begins to crave what
he thinks he can't have. (Remember, "People want
what they cannot have" is the strongest law of
human nature.) By simply following these natural
sexual patterns, women can make men into drooling
puppets.

# Turning the tables

The shrewd man, after sizing up this situation,
turns the tables and exploits human nature himself,
instead of playing the dupe. He discards the customary male predator role that undercuts most men.
This aggressive stalking gives away the man's need.
And human nature decrees that the moment a
woman senses that someone needs her sexually, she
usually screeches on her mental brakes. As long as
the male's pursuit betrays his need, women play
coy-dispensing their favors sparingly.
But when the tables are turned via the manipulation of her human nature, the woman can be led to
assume the predator role. If they're handled right,
women will become the aggressors. After all, they do
feel the sex drive almost as strongly as men do.
And in addition to this need for sex, American society implants in women a strong need to have their
sexual attractiveness affirmed. Men provide this vote
of confidence by chasing them constantly.
Once a man begins to act uninterested in sex with
a woman, he tells her subtly, "I don't need you." At
first this only sparks a woman's curiosity because few
men on the prowl behave this way. But her mild consternation quickly turns to panic if his cool sexual behavior continues.
Suddenly her human nature is touched off. Now
she thinks he doesn't need her. So instinct makes her
itch for what she feels she can't have. She begins to
doubt her own sexual attractiveness. With her human
nature stirred up, she jumps into the sexual-stalker
role. 
  <br/>
By feigning a lack of concern for sex with a woman
at the start of the relationship, a man immediately
tilts the balance of power in his favor. With her instincts aroused, she'll make the opening moves to satisfy her sex need and to affirm her attractiveness. So
by tampering with human nature, the man restructures the typical man-woman relationship. He places the need in the woman's corner. Now, to a large extent, the man can dispense his favors at will.
However, when the subject is switched from sex to
marriage, women often backslide from the shrewd
manhandlers to the dupes, while men naturally
emerge as the manipulators. Why? Women usually
feel the strongest need for marriage because of social
pressure from parents, relatives, and friends. On the
other hand, many men see it as a restriction of their
freedom. <br/>

Because they usually want to get married more
than men, women openly demonstrate their need.
And sensing this need, a man's human nature throws
on the mental brakes. <br//>
But when a woman plays her hand cleverly, she
completely turns things around. By using the "I don't
need you" technique and indicating that "I'd still like
to play around awhile," she stirs his human instincts. Now he's beginning to think she doesn't need
marriage, and he wonders where he stands with her.
Suddenly he's insisting that "I believe it's time to
settle down and marry." She then concedes "reluctantly. "


# How this tactic applies to business dealings

While Hardy sold west Texas land for a fly-bynight real estate corporation, he showed me a trick
that uses "I don't need you" in a business setting. He
was peddling land to people who answered a newspa-per ad that promised "Beautiful West Texas Land
Dirt Cheap!"
1 knew he was working for a respectable, rocksolid firm because its world headquarters was a mobile home situated in a gravel parking lot off a Houston freeway. And they paid their salesmen's
commissions in cash on the spot, which is why
Hardy hired on there.
The company brochure pictured wooded Texas
meadows washed by clear streams. But the actual
plots probably resembled the moon's landscape closer
than they did the lush, green photos in the pamphlets.
This was Hardy's ploy: He told his prospects that
if he sold fifteen lots that month, the management
was sending him on a trip to Acapulco. (He fabricated the whole thing, of course.) Next, he hung up a
chart in his trailer office with fifteen circles on it, and
he would write a person's name in a circle if that person bought a lot from him. This made the customers
think they could help him get to Acapulco.
Now here comes the shrewd twist. As soon as he
put the chart up, he wrote a made-up name in every
circle. Then he wrote in big letters, "I won my trip
to Acapulco!" Get the idea?
As a background let me describe Hardy's financial
condition at the time he pulled this one. He had
blown all his money during the two-week drunk he'd
just come off. And he even had to resort to wiring his
mother back in Alabama for enough money to eat.

But no customer would ever get the idea how desperately he needed a commission from selling a lot.
Instead he told them confidently, "I don't need to
sell you any land; 1 sell plenty of land. Look, I just
won a trip. You're the one that needs the land. It's
beautiful land just like you want, and you need to buy
it before it goes any higher." So he shifted the need to
his customers' corner.
His ploy worked. Using it Hardy sold more lots
the first week he worked there than all the rest of the
salesmen put together. Putting himself back in the
chips once more, he made $2, I50 in six days on the
job.
Hardy knew that if he had put lots up on his chart
as he sold them, customers would sense that he
needed a sale badly to win his trip. Suspecting his
desperation, every customer would have balked and
haggled him to death before giving him the sale he
needed.
I also watched Hardy use the "I don't need you"
tactic to outwit a customer in another clever manipulation. He had just sold a woman a piece of land. But
no sooner had the woman walked out the door than
the sales manager told my friend that another salesman had already sold the lot thirty minutes before.
Hardy would have to switch the woman to another
lot or lose the commission from the sale. And he
knew this wouldn't be easy. After all, the woman had
picked that particular lot out because it bordered on a
creek that ran through the development.

Most people would have called the woman on the
phone and apologized for selling her sold land. Then
she would know Hardy needed her to switch to another lot. Her human nature, seizing upon his obvious need, would have decreed, "No! Get me the land
I picked or nothing."
Instead Hardy called her and said, "You need to
come down to the office. I've got something to tell
you." When she got there, he told her, "My boss tells
me you're gonna have trouble building your house on
that piece of land you bought."
"Really?" the woman tensed.
"Yep. The county won't let you put a bathroom in
that close to the creek. You might contaminate it."
"Oh, no. You're kidding," she said, looking sick to
the heart.
(Notice the way Hardy shoved the need to the
woman's side rather than on his, where it belonged. I
can't agree with his ethics-I couldn't bring myself to
lie this way. But this gives you an idea of how it
works. Obviously the woman believed that she
needed Hardy now. She thought she was stuck with
the land she'd "bought," but couldn't do anything
with it. So Hardy had opened her up to his final
thrust.)
"Now I've got another lot that's almost like yours,
and it's pretty close to the creek. But it's far enough
away that they'll let you build a house with a
bathroom," he proposed.
"I want that one," she insisted.
"We can probably switch it for you. It may be sold 
though; so don't get your hopes up yet," he cautioned, to set her up. (He knew it wasn't sold.) "But
it'll cost you a little more, since it's a little nicer
land," he delivered his fell stroke.
As a result of his manipulation, Hardy easily
switched the woman to the other lot. Although he
told her the new land was "nicer" and charged her
$300 more for it, it was actually the same size. (And
probably looked exactly like hers, give or take a few
tumbleweed that blew across it.)
By the time he hiked the price on her and clinched
the deal, Hardy had raised his commission from $200
to $275. But she paid the extra money because she
thought she needed the other land, and that Hardy
was only trying to help her get it.
This deal may seem penny ante, and it is, but the
human principles in this situation work the same as
those in a deal worth thousands of dollars. If you can
manipulate people on the small deals, you can swing
the big ones too. Human nature doesn't change just
because the numbers do. People are still people, and
they basically kick and claw the same way for a buck
regardless of the size of the stakes.
Certainly the dollar amount was paltry on these
bogus land deals. But $2,150 worth of them a week
kept Hardy eating filet mignon for lunch and lamb
with mint jelly for supper-all of which isn't bad for
a country-boy drunk who couldn't even read a phone
book.
Hardy's use of the "I don't need you" tactic in a
business setting should give you some idea of its po-
tential. You can use your creativity to discover how
this tactic will help you manipulate people in your
business. If you'll think about it, you can devise ways
to convey to the people you deal with the notion that
they need you, rather than vice versa. Then use their
state of mind to your own advantage.

# Keep your nut small so you'll be able to use this tactic 

Business people refer to a "nut" as the overhead a
business must pay every month to survive. On an individual basis your nut consists of all the payments
you must make each month to stay afloat financially.
This includes your rent or house payments, car note,
insurance, and other fixed payments. <br/>

It may surprise you to learn that the size of your
nut can determine your success or failure in many
bargaining situations-for instance, in getting what
you want from your boss. (Or if you're selfemployed, your success or failure in negotiating with
your clients.) The problem with a large nut is that it
hangs a millstone around your neck as you bargain.
If you're strapped by large expenses, using the "I
don't need you" technique becomes very difficult.
You can't afford to walk away from a deal that
doesn't suit you, because you crave a steady flow of
cash to make all your payments. All your car notes,
rent, furniture notes, and so forth hover in the back
of your mind as you negotiate. So you probably can't
muster the nerve to convince the other guy that he
has to meet your terms.  <br/>

Remember-the person who can afford to walk
away from a deal he doesn't like will generally get his
way in any bargaining. So a small nut confers great
manipulative advantages on you. You can afford a
period of little or no income if you don't get this deal,
and your manner will convey that fact to the other
party.<br/>
Consider how the size of your nut undercuts your
ability to extract what you want from your boss. If
you're deluged with monthly payments for your cars,
stereo, and house, you can't very well quit your job if
your boss won't meet your terms. You've got to have
a steady paycheck, so you can't afford a period of
unemployment spent looking for another job. As a
result, your large nut almost enslaves you to your
boss. You pretty much have to take whatever you're
gIven. <br/>
Bargaining with a big nut amounts to negotiating
with your back to the wall. You know you've got
huge expenses to meet. And your demeanor usually
betrays your desperation enough for the other party
to sense it too. With such minuscule leverage, you'll
be lucky to walk away from the situation with the
shirt on your back.

# Silence says, "/ don't need you."

I'm sure you've endured the experience of talking
to a person who gets the idea that he doesn't need
you, but that you need him. He condescends to you
by not responding to what you say. He even acts like
he's not listening.  

But there's a simple remedy for this smugness that
can quickly restore your rightful place in the conversation. The moment you detect this kind of condescension, ask the other party a question, then shut
up. Don't say another word until he responds to your
question, even if a ten-minute silence ensues.
Silence is the strongest pressure to answer that you
can apply. By silently insisting that he respond to
your query, you're implying, "I don't need you near
enough to put up with any of your rudeness." I've
used this ploy many times, and it's never failed to restore the other person's respect for my place in the
conversation. <br/>
Although on paper this tactic might look like it
would anger the other guy, it doesn't. My experience
has shown me that this silent treatment makes the
other person pay attention to what you say and respond to it, without making him mad

# The risk you take

When you use the "I don't need you" technique in
any setting, you're taking a calculated risk. The risk
is that as you try to manipulate some people, this tactic will actually work against you. These are the people who award their favors, money, or friendship to
people they think need their help.
I would estimate that no more than five to ten percent of the public operates this way. But if you apply
this tactic in your manipulation of these people, you
may lose out simply because they think you don't
need their patronage. As a result, your disclaimer of 
need becomes a calculated risk. But remember that
only five to ten percent of the public operates in this
manner. So the odds are stacked ninety to ninety-five
percent in your favor every time you use this
method-not exactly a riverboat-gambler risk.
Bear in mind that the overwhelming majority still
blindly follows its human nature. They believe that
"if you don't need me, you must have something
going for you."
You'll see this vast majority standing in long, shoving lines leading to a popular restaurant. They reason,
in lemming fashion, that a restaurant that doesn't need
their business must be a better place to eat than one
that does need it. Among this majority, you'll discover that "I don't need you" works like sorcery.
You can use this tactic in any persuasion-from
getting a job, and a raise after you get it, to manipulating the people in your love life. Also, understanding the technique should make you wary of
being manipulated by others who try to use it on
you. You may be surprised to discover that, despite
their smug facade, these people really do need
you-if you're sharp enough to call their bluff.
