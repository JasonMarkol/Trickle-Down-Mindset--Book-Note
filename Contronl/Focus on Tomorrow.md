Why is it that when the boss walks into the room, people ’ s voices
drop, everybody looks in his or her direction, and a sense of anticipation tends to build? It is because the only one in the room who
knows where we are going — in other words, who knows about
tomorrow—is the leader or CEO who just walked in. We all want
to know where we will be tomorrow. In fact, whenever a boss or
leader enters the room, his or her first obligation is to share some of
the latest news that only the boss gets to know or would happen to
have. This is, in fact, one of the most powerful reasons why being
a trusted strategic advisor is such an interesting position to hold:
having that view, before anyone else, of where we are headed,
which you can get only when standing next to and being around
the person at the head of the line. <br/>
Leaders work in a future tense. The CEO is the chief strategist, and strategy is always about tomorrow ’ s goals. This is because
leadership is truly about tomorrow and what lies ahead. Contrast
this with much of the staff activity in your own experience. Some
people are busy defending yesterday and justifying things that have
not yet happened, while still trying to leverage their way forward
absent the kind of forward thinking and extraordinary insight
leaders tend to expect.  
<br/>

Leaders avoid yesterday thinking because it can be very confusing and unproductive. Besides, yesterday is already owned by
everybody else from their own perspectives. The past is owned
by others intellectually, sometimes physically, perhaps financially,
and certainly emotionally. And everyone ’ s perception of yesterday is unique and often largely erroneous. The fascination of leadership
and leaders is that most of their work is in territory yet to be owned
or occupied by anyone. This is the definition of tomorrow, an
intellectual area where people can come together and build their
futures collaboratively. In current business language, we would
say tomorrow is where it is possible to engineer new solutions and
ideas. Tomorrow is where most people want to be in some positive,
constructive way. 
 <br/>
The trusted strategic advisor can only be a force for tomorrow.
The closer you are in tune with tomorrow, the more compatible
you are likely to be with the leaders you are advising.
