Why is it that when the boss walks into the room, people ’ s voices
drop, everybody looks in his or her direction, and a sense of anticipation tends to build? It is because the only one in the room who
knows where we are going — in other words, who knows about
tomorrow—is the leader or CEO who just walked in. We all want
to know where we will be tomorrow. In fact, whenever a boss or
leader enters the room, his or her first obligation is to share some of
the latest news that only the boss gets to know or would happen to
have. This is, in fact, one of the most powerful reasons why being
a trusted strategic advisor is such an interesting position to hold:
having that view, before anyone else, of where we are headed,
which you can get only when standing next to and being around
the person at the head of the line. <br/>
Leaders work in a future tense. The CEO is the chief strategist, and strategy is always about tomorrow ’ s goals. This is because
leadership is truly about tomorrow and what lies ahead. Contrast
this with much of the staff activity in your own experience. Some
people are busy defending yesterday and justifying things that have
not yet happened, while still trying to leverage their way forward
absent the kind of forward thinking and extraordinary insight
leaders tend to expect.  
<br/>

Leaders avoid yesterday thinking because it can be very confusing and unproductive. Besides, yesterday is already owned by
everybody else from their own perspectives. The past is owned
by others intellectually, sometimes physically, perhaps financially,
and certainly emotionally. And everyone ’ s perception of yesterday is unique and often largely erroneous. The fascination of leadership
and leaders is that most of their work is in territory yet to be owned
or occupied by anyone. This is the definition of tomorrow, an
intellectual area where people can come together and build their
futures collaboratively. In current business language, we would
say tomorrow is where it is possible to engineer new solutions and
ideas. Tomorrow is where most people want to be in some positive,
constructive way. 
 <br/>
The trusted strategic advisor can only be a force for tomorrow.
The closer you are in tune with tomorrow, the more compatible
you are likely to be with the leaders you are advising.

# Make It Up as They Go

One of the greatest surprises about leaders is that much of what
they do is more or less made up on the spot. I discovered this early
in my career, when I had the chance to coach the CEO of a large
insurance company in the Midwest. To coach at this level, you
have to meet the person you will be coaching ahead of the scheduled session, and there has to be an almost instant chemistry: Can
you work together? Do you have the feeling that you are both on
the same page? <br/>

My “ beauty contest ” interview with this CEO took place in his
wonderful, exotic offi ce on top of a very tall building. The view was
amazing. The offi ce had three full window walls; it was awesome.
It was also really intimidating. <br/>

As we began talking, it was pretty evident that he had a
“ visitor management approach, ” no doubt because visitors asked
the same questions about the view every time. The moment I
started to speak, he took my arm, led me fi rst to window number one, then around the perimeter answering all the questions about each wall — pointing out landmarks, history, useful
detail — at about forty - fi ve to sixty seconds per window. As he
began explaining the third window view, my brain was screaming
at me: “ Say something really important, real soon. Only one wall left, and that one has the door you came through. ” My mental
voice commanded, “ If you want to get this job, you ’ d better ask
an important question now. ” <br/>

So I managed to interrupt the CEO with a question: “ Tell me
something: Do you always know what to do? You run a company
of fourteen thousand employees; I have a company of fourteen
employees. My people expect me to solve today ’ s problems and
move ahead for tomorrow, following a plan. Do you know what to
do every minute? ” <br/>

He looked at me, smiled, and said, “ Don ’ t you ever tell anybody
this, but I think the board actually hired me because I had a good
sense of where we would have to go or need to go, and because
at least half of my decisions would be carried out by people who
really knew what they were doing. They felt that I could estimate,
and make the right decisions in the gray areas at least 25 percent
of the time. The remaining 25 percent they sort of left to me. They
didn ’ t have the answers for this either. For that particular part of
my job, I am on my own. ” <br/>

“But I ’ ll tell you something, ” he continued, pointing at the
door, “ every employee in this company thinks I have the answers.
They think that I have a plan. I ’ ve got news for you: there really is
no grand plan. We have only partial knowledge of how it is going
to go. But if I were going to tell this to the people who work for
me, they wouldn ’ t believe it for a minute. ” <br/>

What I learned from that encounter, and it has stayed with
me ever since, is that CEOs in particular are making it up about
25 percent of the time. They have to create what is next. They
are making it up based on their experience or lack of it, on their
concerns or their fears, and oftentimes on the perceived opportunities as well. This is an extremely interesting and powerful tool
for advisors to have. When I am in meetings, and the meetings
are wandering around off the track, once in a while I will turn to
the CEO and ask, “ Is this the part we know how to do or the part
we are making up? ” It is amazing how stunningly accurate this
question can be. <br/>
