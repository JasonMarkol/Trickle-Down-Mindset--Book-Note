 What dies at death is suddenly no longer vital, or even
relevant, and what you “take with you”, the essential YOU right now, is
all that really matters. Think of how differently you would go about your
life, if you were not haunted by fear, if you were crystal clear about what
matters most, and if you knew that you have forever to live it.

Immortality infinitely expands the stage of life…literally. It puts all the
strivings and struggles of existence into a very different context, making
them much less dire and onerous, and compelling you to reconsider just
what you are made of and what is truly important. You are no longer
driven by survival instincts and animal appetites as bottom line  imperatives. What dies at death is suddenly no longer vital, or even
relevant, and what you “take with you”, the essential YOU right now, is
all that really matters. Think of how differently you would go about your
life, if you were not haunted by fear, if you were crystal clear about what
matters most, and if you knew that you have forever to live it. <br/>

Yes, I know, “IF” is a big word here. None of this matters unless it is
true. Many would say that immortality, or the soul, or other dimensions
of existence are impossible to prove, so all such discussions are purely
academic. Stop wasting your time, kid, get real. But I propose that you
CAN prove it through your own direct experience, and that when you
do, you will realize that “reality” encompasses much more than you ever
dreamed possible. And I’ll show you HOW you can prove it for yourself
through step by step actions.
<br/>
Again, I am not talking about just believing you have a soul. Many would
say they already believe in a spiritual life. But mere belief does not hold
up in the foxhole. I am talking about experiencing your immortal nature
here and now, in the cold, hard light of day, amidst the drudgery and
duress of physical existence. About eventually never lapsing in the
awareness of whom and what you really are.
<br/>
This takes time and effort, of course. As with the cultivation of any
subtle skill, you have to train yourself through persistent application of
specific exercises. They are scientific, time-tested and yielding
predictable results, but they are not instantaneous. Right from the start
you will get inklings of your inner life, and as you deepen your practice,
you gradually come to complete certainty. In the meantime, it is
necessary to keep motivated through reason and imagination. So let’s go
over the reasons to bother with this at all.
<br/>
As already mentioned, if you know you are essentially immortal, you will
naturally live with much less worry and hurry, and you will get evermore
clear about what matters and what does not. This is because, on the
immortal stage, you realize an expanded perspective that spontaneously
confers greater peace and presence of mind. These alone are powerful reasons to at least consider this personal experiment. Just imagine your
life changed in these ways. Who would deny wanting such advantages?
But this is just the beginning. There are many additional inherent benefits
to realizing your immortality…it gets better and better!
<br/>
To make further discussion easier, let’s give this yet-to-be-proved
immortal aspect of existence a name. I’m fine with the soul word, but
some people have baggage around that term, so let’s just call it the Self
(capitalized); your Real Self, the essential You, as distinct from the small
self, the striving-to-survive-human-animal aspect of your mortal
experience, all the stuff that inevitably dies.
<br/>
So what are the attributes of the Self? Testimony from the ages tells us
it is the well-spring of life itself, the source of all your highest and noblest
qualities and abilities; your faculties of intuition, your powers of
creativity, your capacities to love, to empathize, to truly understand any
other person, indeed, your inseverable connection with all that lives. It
endows you with immunity to all mental, emotional, and physical disease.
It is inexhaustibly energizing and inspiring. It gives purpose and guidance
in every circumstance. That’s for starters.
