# LEARNING FROM OBSERVATION
You may not know it but much of what you learn throughout life is imitation of what you see. When you learn to walk, as a baby, you learn because you have seen other people walk. As you grew older, you learned to look at people around you and compare yourself to them. In your teens, you probably wanted to wear the kind of clothing that kids of your age thought of as “cool” but that your parents may not have approved of. The point is that you have spent your whole life measuring yourself against others and at this stage in your life now consider yourself less worthy than those around you – for whatever reason.

You may also have been influenced by what you saw in magazines or on the television but these are not real people. Many prepare themselves to appear on the TV and will have first class makeup artists. You may think that you are not that attractive in comparison but every day you have the opportunity to see the other side of the coin but avoid it. What we are going to suggest to you is a purposeful journey into observation. If you can find a busy café where you can sit and observe the world, this is one of the best places for this exercise.

# Learning about the way people present themselves

If you have an image in your mind as to how you should appear, you may be being unfair to yourself. Look around you and look for the following attributes because you will see what a nonsense it is to think that you have less value than all of the people that surround you. If you think that you don’t have a boyfriend/girlfriend because you are too ugly, look at those people who have partners. They are not the beautiful people. They are simply people like you that have been fortunate enough to find others that are suitable as partners. Be realistic. The girl over there isn’t the perfect weight and yet she looks completely happy and is surrounded by friends. The man over there isn’t the most fashion conscious but he walks with confidence and people turn their heads when he passes.

The way that you see yourself is always going to be unrealistic if you don’t see the world for what it truly is. There are people out there who are worse off than you are. Look at the old lady over there begging for someone to give her money for a cup of coffee. Her back may be bent and she may not have decent clothing like yours but she doesn’t hate herself. Her circumstances are just different to yours. Observation of others is vital because it shows you that the world in general isn’t a place where comparisons should be made. Everyone is so different that if you were to compare, it would be unfair and yet this is what you do to yourself every day of the week. All you should ever hope is that you present yourself to the world in the best way possible. Look for the following attributes in people around you:
<br/>
·         Who looks happy? <br/>
·        Who looks like he/she has confidence? <br/>
·       How do confident people approach the world?<br/>
·        Does posture have anything to do with how you see people? <br/>
·        Do people smile? <br/>
·        If they look miserable, do you see them as attractive?<br/>

The idea of this exercise is NOT comparison. The idea is OBSERVATION. By observing you can learn a great deal about what YOU may or may not be doing that you don’t particularly like. Since we have already said that it is important that you like yourself, the first place to look is at others to see what is likeable about them that you don’t do. How do they dress? How do they interact with others? Look at those people around you and then go home because the next observation you are going to do is on yourself. It’s quite important that you do these two exercises in conjunction with each other so that you can use the first experience to help you with the second experience.

# The Mirror Test

In this test, you need a full length mirror and should place it in your bedroom where you can see yourself clearly when you enter the bedroom door. Having posed your mirror, now go out of the room and enter. As you do, look and observe yourself in the mirror and pretend that this is the first time you have seen this person that you are looking at. Do you slouch? Do you look in a downward direction? What are you doing with your hands? How are you dressed? Look at your hair. Is it nicely brushed and neat? Look at your skin. Is it in tip top condition? The point of doing this is to see who you are at the moment. You don’t like yourself very much but all of that is about to change. You need to present yourself to the world in a way that you find acceptable because once you are comfortable about the way that you present yourself, you lose a little part of that self-esteem problem. This is the physical look rather than looking at what’s going on inside of you.
<br/>
Now look at how you can improve your look. Perhaps you walk with your shoulders down. What you learned from watching people was how people that have confidence walk. They will have their shoulders back. Their head will look straight ahead. They will have a confident look on their faces but do you think they were always like that. Go out of the room and consciously practice that look and see for yourself how different you look when you enter a room with an air of confidence. People are much more drawn to you as a personality because you are not giving all the body language that you are needy and have psychological problems. Now try walking into the room and sitting. Again, do this naturally as you normally would and observe how different your stance is to that of people who have confidence in themselves. When you have self-esteem issues, you tend to not worry about your posture. You don’t take care of the way that you sit and you are likely to slump. Now, do it again being aware of your posture and the smile on your face. You should look happy, rather than ridiculously grinning and should hold your head high. From this exercise you can gather than what you are depends upon what you show people. What people see is what they judge you upon. If they see you as the timid mouse who slouches about and needs too much attention all of the time, you alienate people. If, however, you have the air of confidence and can display yourself as being confident by your stature, their approach to you is different. It’s not all about looks but the way that people behave toward you is as a direct consequence of what you present them with. You also need to learn about posture for the meditation exercises in a later chapter, but it’s a good time to start practicing the way that you look because this helps you to gain confidence in yourself as well as helping others to see you for the true person that you are. You are not pretending. You are merely making the most of yourself and presenting yourself in a way that people see as positive, rather than negative. Most of your experiences with self-esteem will have come about not because of the actions of other people, but because of the way that you interact with those people. There is no blame here. You need to accept that everyone is trying to get through life in the best way that they know how, but if they are faced with someone with negative thoughts about themselves, they can see straight through it and will treat you very differently from someone who has a little pride and takes care of their appearance. It therefore makes sense that the first step you take on the road toward discovering the new you comes from your posture, your approach and the way that you interact with others.
