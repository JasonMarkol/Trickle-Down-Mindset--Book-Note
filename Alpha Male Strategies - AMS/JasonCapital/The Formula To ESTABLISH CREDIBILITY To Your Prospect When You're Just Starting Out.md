content twister..

Why content? - establish credibility(可靠性) with your audience 


[So where exactly did I get credibility here?]

CONTENT establishes credibility. You create content on a daily basis using the content twister. If your competitor is putting out content everyday and you're not, then they have the credibility, and you will lose.




Is your content inconsistent?

This is the same formula I use to make sure that I have content ready to post every single day. With the content twister, you can establish the credibility that is necessary to move your audience from spectators to buyers.

Think of the top 3-5 things that make you credible, and base your content around those things. It's as simple as that.
