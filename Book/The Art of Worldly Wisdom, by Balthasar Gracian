# Keep Matters for a Time in Suspense.

Admiration at their novelty heightens the value of your achievements, It is both useless and insipid to play with the cards on the table. If you do not declare yourself immediately, you arouse expectation, especially when the importance of your position makes you the object of general attention. Mix a little mystery with everything, and the very mystery arouses veneration. And when you explain, be not too explicit, just as you do not expose your inmost thoughts in ordinary intercourse. Cautious silence is the holy of holies of worldly wisdom. A resolution declared is never highly thought of; it only leaves room for criticism. And if it happens to fail, you are doubly unfortunate. Besides you imitate the Divine way when you cause men to wonder and watch. 
<br/>
在悬念中保持一段时间。

钦佩他们的新奇提高了你的成就的价值，在桌子上玩牌是既没用也不平淡。 如果你不立即宣布自己，你会引起期待，特别是当你的位置的重要性使你成为普遍关注的对象。 把所有的东西都混合起来，这个神秘的东西引起了人们的崇敬。 当你解释的时候，不要太明确，就像你在平常的交往中不要暴露自己的想法一样。 谨慎的沉默是世间智慧圣洁的圣洁。 宣布的决议永远不会被高度重视。 只留下批评的余地。 如果它发生失败，你是非常不幸的。 除此之外，当你引起人们怀疑和观察的时候，你还会模仿神的方式。

# Never have a Companion who casts you in the Shade

The more he does so, the less desirable a companion he is. The more he excels in quality the more in repute: he will always play first fiddle and you second. If you get any consideration, it is only his leavings. The moon shines bright alone among the stars: when the sun rises she becomes either invisible or imperceptible. Never join one that eclipses you, but rather one who sets you in a brighter light. By this means the cunning Fabula in Martial was able to appear beautiful and


brilliant, owing to the ugliness and disorder of her companions. But one should as little imperil oneself by an evil companion as pay honour to another at the cost of one's own credit. When you are on the way to fortune associate with the eminent; when arrived, with the mediocre.

<br/>

从来没有一个同伴把你投入阴影。

他这样做的越多，他的同伴就越不理想。 他的素质越高越好，他总是第一把戏，第二把。 如果你有任何的考虑，这只是他的离开。 月亮独自在星星之间闪耀：当太阳升起时，它变得不可见或不可见。 永远不要加入一个让你失望的人，而是让你更加明亮的人。 通过这种手段，在Martial的狡猾的法布拉能够显示美丽和

页。

由于她的同伴们的丑陋和混乱，她是一个聪明的人。 但一个人应该以自己的信誉为代价，把一个邪恶的同伴当作自己的荣誉给另一个。 当你在与卓越的关联的途中， 当到达时，与平庸。\

# Do not Believe, or Like, lightly.

Maturity of mind is best shown in slow belief. Lying is the usual thing; then let belief be unusual. He that is lightly led away, soon falls into contempt. At the same


time there is no necessity to betray your doubts in the good faith of others, for this adds insult to discourtesy, since you make out your informant to be either deceiver or deceived. Nor is this the only evil: want of belief is the mark of the liar, who suffers from two failings: he neither believes nor is believed. Suspension of judgment is prudent in a hearer: the speaker can appeal to his original source of in-formation. There is a similar kind of imprudence in liking too easily, for lies may be told by deeds as well as in words, and this deceit is more dangerous for practical life.


<br/>
不要相信，或者不喜欢，轻轻地。

思维的成熟最好以缓慢的信念展现出来。说谎是平常的事情;那么让信仰是不寻常的。轻轻带走的人很快就会被藐视。同样的

时间没有必要背叛你怀疑他人的诚意，因为这样做会使你的告密者不是欺骗就是欺骗。这也不是唯一的罪恶：信仰的缺失是骗子的标志，他有两个缺陷：他既不相信也不相信。听话人的审判是暂时的，讲话者可以呼吁他原来的信息来源。在喜欢的过程中也有类似的倾向，因为谎言可以通过行为和言语告诉，而这种欺骗在现实生活中更危险。
