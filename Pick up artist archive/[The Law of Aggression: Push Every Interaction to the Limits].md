The Law of Aggression: Push Every Interaction to the Limits

Years and years ago, when I first began coaching guys in bars and nightclubs, I had a motto
for a while (affectionately stolen from Glen Gary Glenn Ross): A-B-C, ALWAYS BE
CLOSING!

I would also tell guys to constantly, “Swing for the fences.” I’d go out with some guys,
they’d open well, hook, gain attraction, get her number and come back all giddy and excited.
My response was always, “Why did you stop? Dude… swing for the fucking fences.
ALWAYS BE CLOSING.”

# There are two parts to this mentality: one is to raise the bar high and expect more out of yourself. The second is to find her limits and always push the interaction there.

The first is an inner game issue that afflicts too many guys I run into. Ironically, it’s usually
the guys who are semi-naturals or who have a ton of potential who stumble over this problem
and never improve. They expect too little out of themselves. They become satisfied with
simple achievements rather than aiming for the big leagues. Their fear of failure drives them
to set the bar low in order to make success easy.

They’re satisfied with opening successfully. They’re satisfied if a girl gives them a few IOI’s.
They’re satisfied if they get a couple numbers. They come back saying, “Dude, that girl loved
me!” Really? Then why aren’t you fucking her?

That’s great that they’re satisfied in the short-term. But in the long-term, they’re not getting
laid. They’re not dating multiple girls. They’re not meeting and sleeping with really HIGH
VALUE girls consistently.

Set the bar high. Expect more out of yourself. REALLY challenge yourself and see how far
you can go. Shoot for the higher goals and EXPECT the failure to happen. You’ll be
surprised how easy SNL’s can be, how easy creating a harem can be, how easy getting a real
high quality girl can be — if only you truly try and settle for nothing less.
The other aspect of this mindset is the pure, unbridled aggression — grabbing yourself by the
balls and fucking going for it even when you’re not sure if you should. BradP promised
himself when he started that he would never fail because he didn’t try hard enough, but only
because he went too far. His motto became “Blow me or blow me out.” Gunwitch’s motto
even before that was, “Make the ho say no!”

This attitude should permeate every portion of your sets. Don’t eject until she tells you to go
away. ALWAYS go for the number close. Kino escalate hard and fast at night. Go for the
insta-date during the day. Go for the makeout. Try to get her home with you that night. If not,
then get her home on the day 2. ALWAYS be pushing the envelope.
This is effective on a multitude of levels. First of all, being aggressive means you’re always
LEADING the interaction. You simply CANNOT build attraction without leading an
interaction. It makes you dominant. It makes you sexual. It forces you to escalate quickly and
often — the absence of escalation is the QUICKEST way to kill attraction and the interaction.

Always be moving forward. Always be pushing the interaction. Expect more from yourself.
Swing for the fences. ALWAYS BE CLOSING!
