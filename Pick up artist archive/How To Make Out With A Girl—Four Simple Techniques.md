Hey, it’s Todd Valentine bringing you fundamentals of seduction.

Today’s topic is on how to kiss a girl. This is a very personal topic for me because for a long time I couldn’t kiss girls—even after months of getting numbers and going on multiple dates. I wouldn’t get physical. I had to get over it, and the first thing I realized is that attitude and permission are most important.

 How to Make Out With a Girl -- Four Simple Techniques

You have to give yourself permission to kiss a girl, to make it awkward . . . to fail. If you’re too scared to try, then you’ll end up in the friend zone. You don’t want to miss the window of getting the kiss, because things will not go well after that.

Here are two examples of the low place I was coming from:

I was in college, out on a date with a cute girl, and it went well. I was taking her back to her dorm, and when we got there, I made a hand gesture as I was talking and she took it as me going for a handshake. She said, “Don’t you think a handshake is a little too formal for us to end our date with?” This was code for Kiss me, you idiot! Instead I said, “Yeah, haha, I guess you’re right,” gave her a quick hug, and walked away. A few seconds later I realized how bad I had failed to step up.
This second one was really painful. In college, the same year, I went out a girl with on four dates. We had great chemistry, we liked each other, and she would even get up in my face, so I knew I had to just kiss her, and I still couldn’t make myself do it! So, after four dates she kind of gave up on me and probably thought, All right, this guy has no balls. To make things worse, though, there was a guy that she and I used to joke about because he didn’t make the soccer team (and I did). Well, you can imagine my surprise when she started dating that guy. It was probably because he had more balls, and I have to respect that, but this was a very painful lesson, because I had previously seen that guy and I on completely separate playing fields. It put things into perspective.
This is why it’s so, so, so important to give yourself permission to go in for a kiss.

Another piece of advice regarding physical escalation is this: it doesn’t all have to be at once. Two steps forward, one step back. So if you go for the kiss and get denied, realize that no can really mean “not yet.”

My last piece of encouragement before I get to the techniques is this: I’ve never lost a girl by going for the kiss, but I have lost the girl by not going for the kiss.

This doesn’t mean that every time I go for it, I actually kiss her, but here’s the thing: the purpose of the kiss is not to get the kiss—the kiss isn’t that important (I’ve slept with girls I never kissed). A kiss simply conveys a-man-to-woman—not platonic—vibe. So even if she denies the kiss but continues the conversation, that’s fine. She now knows that you’re the type of guy who will go for a kiss.

With that said, I’m going to give you four specific techniques you can use to get the kiss, especially if you’re not experienced.

1. Triangular Gazing

This is an old-school favorite, and it’s easy and relatively safe. When you’re looking at a girl, slow down, look her in the eye, then mouth, then other eye, then mouth, then first eye. The purpose is to bring focus to her lips. Let your eyes linger on the lips and then look back up to the eyes.

This communicates a sensual message, and you’ll see her receive it. She may smile, get aroused, slow down, or lean toward you. If that’s the case, go for the kiss. If you do this and get anything but a negative reaction, start to lean in slightly and see how she reacts. If she’s not resistant, keep leaning in. And if she backs away, return to normal conversation and try again later.

The cool thing about this technique is that it allows you to try for the kiss in a way that’s not so blatant. So if you get a negative rejection, it’s not a big deal, and it’s easy to take a step back before you try again.

2. General Physical Escalation

Remember Two steps forward, one step back? Well, kissing is just one more form of physical escalation, and you can work your way up to the kiss with things like the Eskimo Kiss (nose to nose, back and forth—you can even tell her No lips! I’m serious! as if you don’t want her to kiss you). If a girl is okay with this, then you know you could kiss her. Although it’s probably not the best idea to go for the kiss immediately after that, you at least know that she’ll be comfortable enough to kiss you at another point in the night.

Another thing you can do is brush her hair off of her face and put it behind her ear. Or go in close and tell her a secret, then brush your lips against her ear or neck. You can even give a little bite if you think she’d be receptive to that.

Actions like these are preliminary to kissing, and they do a good job of leading up to the kiss so it’s more natural when it happens.

3. Eyes Closed Kiss

This technique is perfect for putting a girl into a situation where she can’t be held responsible. Oftentimes, when escalating physically and in sexual ways, the girl really is attracted to you and wants something to happen, but she doesn’t want to be responsible for it; she doesn’t want to feel slutty. If you get that vibe, that everything else has gone well but she’s resistant to you trying for the kiss, try the eyes closed kiss.

Come up with a premise and tell her something like, Close your eyes; I’m gonna show you something. And then, while her eyes are closed, you simply go in for the kiss.

A word of caution: sometimes when I’ve tried this, the girl will act surprised or even truly be surprised and say, You tricked me! Interestingly, though, most of the time these same girls will be receptive to the kiss if I go for it again later.

Once you’ve crossed a threshold (your lips have brushed hers or touched her, for example), it’s like you’ve already kissed—so there’s rarely more resistance. And remember, if she stays, she’s staying because she really does want the kiss, because you’re the guy who will go for it. This method is a great way to take the burden off her shoulders.

4. The Gangster

This is my favorite technique, and it’s definitely the most ballsy. Your goal is to make the situation so awkward and the fact that you’re going for the kiss so blatant that going for it is actually less awkward than not.

A great example of this is if you’re on a date with a girl. You're sitting there, you both have your wineglasses. Then you suddenly go silent in the conversation. You look at her and give her a shh. You slowly set down your wineglass, get up, slowly walk over to her, take her wineglass out of her hand, set it down, grab her head, and slowly start kissing her.

Because you’re being so blatant—starting with the shh and setting down your wineglass, there is massive sexual tension. And once you take her wineglass and set it down, it’s pretty much a done deal.

The other nice thing about this technique is that if you’re feeling nervous about it as you start, by the time you’ve grabbed her glass, you’ve created so much tension that it would be weirder and more awkward for you not to kiss her. You’ve essentially created your own momentum to get it done.

Yet another nice thing about this technique is that it creates a dramatic, romantic, sensual kiss for the girl: one that builds an intense sexual relationship vibe and one she’ll surely remember you for. I often do this if I’m sitting across from the girl, or I use it as a way to bridge the gap, to get the kiss and create an intimacy that otherwise wouldn’t have been there.

So there you have four techniques to get you the kiss. But remember, the most important factor is your attitude. You must know that as a man, it’s your responsibility to take action and step up.

Again, I’ve never lost a girl by going for the kiss, but I’ve lost girls by not going for it. Don’t miss your window. Simply trying for the kiss improves the interaction and makes it man-to-woman.

So get out three, go for the kiss, and make it happen. See you next time.
