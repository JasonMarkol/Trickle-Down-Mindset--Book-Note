This subreddit sometimes teaches you to try to make and hold eye contact with women during the day. 

<br/>This is good to do to hone your social confidence, but it won't really get you anywhere. If you happen to have a frown on your face from a busy day, they won't want you looking at them and will look away. 

<br/>
If you have a serious/grumpy look while you're concentrating on trying to remember everything you learned here, they'll think you look creepy and they'll look away. Either way, when they look away it'll be a slight dent to your confidence. "I tried to make eye contact with everyone, but they always look away"
Smile at them instead. I don't mean walk around with a smile on your face, and I don't mean smile while you make eye contact with them - I mean smile AT them. Give them a smile meant only for them. 

<br/>
You will be blown away at how many girls smile right back at you, even if they don't hold your eye contact.
