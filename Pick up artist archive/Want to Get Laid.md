If you want to get laid by beautiful, sexy women then you’ve definitely found the website that will truly teach you what you need to know to succeed.

The first thing you need to know how to do is approach women.

If you hide behind online dating, you will be competing 100s and sometimes 1,000s of guys for the one woman. However, when you approach a woman in person, it’s just you and her. Watch this video to learn how to build up the confidence to approach women…

The second thing you need to do if you want to get laid is learn how to attract women when you interact with them.

Most guys assume that women are mostly attracted to looks, money and social status in guys. Yes, those things can attract women, but the majority of women have what I call an Open Type, which means that they are open to being with all different types of guys, as long as the guy knows how to make them feel enough attraction based on his personality and behavior.

If you want to get laid, the third thing you need to know is that most women are open to having sex on the first night or first date. Women don’t go around admitting it, but several studies have found that up to 70% of women admit to having had a one night stand before.

…and that’s just those who admit it.

Most of the women I’ve had sex with pretend like it’s the first time they are ever having sex on the first night or first date. Why? They have to put on an act of being innocent, otherwise most guys wouldn’t be able to trust them in a relationship.

In the past, women had to save themselves for marriage and the man would feel great that he was getting to have sex with her first. Nowadays, women have to act innocent so guys feel like they are the first to stick it in her.

It’s not women’s fault and it’s not guy’s fault; it’s just modern society. Things aren’t going to go back to how they were in 1905. These days, everyone is enjoying the freedom to have sex with whomever they want and as a modern man, you either accept that and get involved or watch from the outside as everyone else has sex and enjoys love and relationships without you.
