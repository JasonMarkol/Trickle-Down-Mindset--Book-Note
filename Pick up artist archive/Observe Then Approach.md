Observe Then Approach
<br/>
Knowledge is power. Always listen to and observe everything, including other’s conversations.
<br/>
If you take the time to observe a woman before you approach her, you may notice something she is doing, wearing or talking about which in-a-way “tells you” what to say when you try to spark up a conversation with her.
<br/>
It is a common myth that in order to be successful you need to approach a woman immediately once you’ve seen her.
<br/>
The most common being the “3 second rule”, which is very effective once you’re really good at approaching women, but can also be a huge pitfall for beginners.
<br/>
Once your skills have evolved you will easily be able to think of unique openers to use impromptu in the field within 3 seconds, but during your journey of skill development, it is much more important to plan your moves properly than it is to act upon impulse.
<br/>
Take baby steps and give yourself room to grow, as this is not an overnight process.
<br/>
When you approach a woman within 30 seconds with a great situational opener, you will have a much better chance of success than you would have if you approached her within 3 seconds with a lame, canned or common line.
