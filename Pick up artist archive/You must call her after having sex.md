Don Diebel: Listen up guys. I can’t begin to tell you how important this tip is. After you have had sex with a woman you must call her the very next day (this is especially critical for a woman you have just met or very early in a relationship.) So, what’s the big deal? It’s a very, very big deal to a woman giving her body to you. It’s very special to her and she expects to hear from you the next day. If she doesn’t she will feel used and that you don’t have any respect for her. The bad thing about this is she may be so upset and angry towards you that she won’t care to have intimate relations with you again and that’s bad news for you. You really need to call her the next day just out of respect, if for no other reason.

There’s an exception to the rule. That is if you really were just using her for sex and don’t care to see her again. In other words, a one-night stand. If it really was just a one-night stand, don’t lead her on by misleading her into thinking that you care for her and want to start a relationship with her. Just don’t call her at all.
