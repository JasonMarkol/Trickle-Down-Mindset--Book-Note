# BNB stands for a Boring Nervous Bonehead
# 正文

Lets face it: most guys fail with women. And they don’t just fail occasionally
with women. They fail over and over again. Do you know a guy who repeatedly
fails with women? Imagine him for a second there in front of you. What are
some examples of the stupid shit he does over and over again? 
<br/>
Men who fail with women tend to share certain characteristics. These tendencies
are present across the spectrum of men of all age groups, degrees of geekiness,
and shapes and sizes. 
<br/>
You could sum up what most men do as acting like a BNB.
BNB stands for a Boring Nervous Bonehead, and most guys act like a BNB
around women.  
<br/>
Most guys act boring, dress boring, use boring and predictable lines with
women, talk about boring things, and as a result women are turned off. 
<br/>
Most guys also are nervous and fearful around women. They’re scared of
approaching, talking to, connecting to, and dealing with women. Scared of
rejection, being laughed at, or just fearful in general. And guess what? Women
can spot a nervous guy a mile away. He telegraphs fear in everything he does,
and then women are forced to reject him. The BNB talks too fast, uses nervous
movements when he talks, and he looks scared shitless. 
<br/>
Here is what the BNB is afraid of being: raw, real, messy, passionate, opinionated,
emotional, and intense.

# Not taking enough risks 

Here’s an example of someone who’s willing to take a risk in showing who he
is and how he acts. It’s from the movie Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back: <br/>

“I am the master of the C.L.I.T. Remember this fucking face.
Whenever you see C.L.I.T., you’ll see this fucking face. I make
that shit work. It does whatever the fuck I tell it to. No one
rules the C.L.I.T. like me.”—Jay, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back
<br/>
Jay is not boring. He’s a lot of things, but he’s not boring. We offer the example
of Jay to get you to wake up. Wake up and notice that the ways you’ve been
acting around women have been boring and predictable. 
<br/>

The first characteristic of BNBs is that they are boring! They ask boring
questions, they do predictable things, and they take very few actual risks with
women. BNBs telegraph that they are boring by dressing boring, by acting like
every other guy does being overly compliant, not getting too close to a woman
when he talks to her—and by being so amazed when a woman does actually
reciprocate in a conversation that he becomes a submissive puppy dog.
<br/>

BNBs never have the balls to take any romantic or sexual risks when they
meet women. We’re not talking about going up and grabbing some random
woman’s tit either. We’re talking about the inability to ask for a number, give
a compliment, give a woman shit, bust her on her bad behavior, or share an
intense emotion. Taking a risk means doing something unpredictable—even if
it might risk rejection, looking stupid, making mistakes, offending a woman,
or even being uncomfortable.

# The BNB will take any woman 

Imagine if you had no standards when it came to buying a car. You might
accept anything from a total piece of shit 1993 Ford Taurus Station Wagon to
a 2006 Ferrari 360 Spider. Is there a difference? Both will get you where you
want go, right? But they are totally different. If you are selective about the
car you drive, why not apply this same selectivity to the women you date? 
<br/>

The BNB has no standards when it comes to dating. The problem is that he will
take any woman who shows up in his life and as a result he gets no women.
If you want to be powerful with women, you’d better have standards. You also
need to devise a way to test the women you meet. If you are serious about
being a Hard to Get Man, you’d better start right now having self-respect and
being willing to test women to find the one you actually like and are attracted
to. We’ll cover this in greater depth in the next chapter.
