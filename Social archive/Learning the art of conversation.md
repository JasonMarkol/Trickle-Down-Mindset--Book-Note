# Learning the art of conversation
1. Copy the other person’s body language to create a
‘mirror image’.
2. Ask three questions – but no more until you have done
the next two things.
3. Find something from what you have just learned that
will allow you to compliment the other person – subtly.
4. Find something in what you have found out to agree
with.
5. Repeat until the conversation takes on a life of its own.
