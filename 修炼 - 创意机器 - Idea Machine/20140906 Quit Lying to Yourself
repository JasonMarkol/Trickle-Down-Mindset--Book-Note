Quit Lying to Yourself 
It is fairly common for people who don’t get what they want 
to provide justifications—and even lie to themselves—by 
minimizing how valuable success is to them. It’s easy to spot 
this trend in our society today within entire demographics 
and population segments. You can read it in books, hear it in 
church, and see it promoted in schools. For example, children 
who can’t get what they want will fi ght for a little while, cry 
for a bit, and then convince themselves that they never wanted 
it in the fi rst place. It is entirely okay to admit that you wanted 
something that didn’t come to fruition. In fact, this is the only 
thing that will help you eventually reach that goal—despite 
the obstacles you’ll encounter along the way.
