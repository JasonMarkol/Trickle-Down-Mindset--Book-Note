What is talent  


what is the solutionï¼Ÿ

The solution is to create a high-quality high performance movie in your mind 

to visualise in a pay particular attention to what your body feels like when you 

are performing at your peak . 

If this was a movie , make it a Blu-ray movie.

Try to add information from all your senses , what does it look, sound,feel,taste and 

smell like?


Be sure that you create a movie of you performing in the moment ; 

taking the shot , playing the chord, swimming the lap, flowing through the test with all the 

easily available to you - the mood it will create will be better for performance than the mood

you create through lifting a trophy or hearing an anthem.
