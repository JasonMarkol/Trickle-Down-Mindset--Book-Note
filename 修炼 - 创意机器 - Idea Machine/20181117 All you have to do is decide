打的不顺你也要把这局打赢了 兄弟 随让你开了  我开着直播也要把这局打赢

I remember walking into my empty room and leaning against the door, won- 
dering how I was going to make it work. I remember friends leaving me and going 
to bed on an empty stomach. There were many days I felt like giving up. Some- 
times I cried and wished I had never been born. But I loved reading books and 
came across a quote by Lou Piniella which read, “You have to learn how to get 
comfortable with being uncomfortable”.  Suddenly I was glad my father had kicked 
me out of his house and disowned me. Firstly, I had to learn to depend on myself 
and then I had to forgive. I first forgave myself and realised why I was in that posi- 
tion.  Then I let go of what was holding me back and forgave him. 
A comfort zone is a place or position in which a person feels secure, comfort- 
able or in control. There are many reasons why people stay in comfort zones and 
they differ with each person. It all depends on where they are in their lives.  In the 
following chapters we shall explore some of those aspects. Then, I will attempt to 
give you a few tips on how you can overcome problems and venture out of your 
own comfort zone. 
Your comfort zone could be the cause of your downfall.  If you stay in it for too 
long, you will become bored and lazy. 
You will be a “dead man walking” and lose the ability to create meaning in your 
life. I want you to know that you can achieve anything you want and you can learn 
any skill you lack.  Walt Disney once said, “All our dreams can come true, if we 
have the courage to pursue them”.  You also need to develop the courage to step 
up and step out. Nothing is stopping you. Other people have done it before, and 
that should be proof enough to you that it is all possible. If I could do it, then you 
can do it too. All you have to do is decide.
